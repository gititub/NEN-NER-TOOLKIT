During the course of identifying other NSAIDs as potential RXRalpha ligands, we found that Sulindac bound to RXRalpha, but not RAR (Figure S1A), with an IC50 of 80 muM (Figure 1A), which is in its concentration range that induces apoptosis. HPLC analysis showed a direct binding of Sulindac to RXRalpha protein but not other nuclear receptors such as RAR and Nur77 in cells (Figure 1B and Figure S1C). The binding was also illustrated by altered sensitivity of RXRalpha ligand-binding domain (LBD) or full-length (fl)-RXRalpha protein to chymotrypsin digestion by Sulindac in vitro (Figure 1C). Furthermore, we took advantage of the presence of fluorine atom in Sulindac and examined 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. Figure 1D shows that the signal intensity of the fluorine spectrum of Sulindac was strongly suppressed by RXRalpha LBD but not by Nur77 protein, demonstrating a direct and specific binding. Sulindac binding inhibited transactivation of RXRalpha homodimers (Figure 1E) and certain heterodimers (Figure 1F and Figure S1B) in the reporter assays, demonstrating that Sulindac is a RXRalpha transactivation antagonist.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7222, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Sulindac Induces RXRalpha-dependent Apoptosis", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7268, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To determine the role of RXRalpha in Sulindac-induced apoptosis, we examined its death effect in F9 cells and F9 cells lacking RXRalpha (F9-RXRalpha-/-). Sulindac induced extensive apoptosis in F9 cells, but had little effect in F9-RXRalpha-/- cells (Figure 2A-2C). Moreover, the apoptotic effect of Sulindac was reduced in cells with diminished RXRalpha level (Figures 2D, E), whereas it was enhanced in cells with ectopically expressed RXRalpha in RXRalpha-negative CV-1 cells (Figure 2F). To address the role of Sulindac binding to RXRalpha, we constructed the RXRalpha/F313S/R316E mutant in which Phe313 and Arg316 essential for maintaining the functional integrity of RXRalpha ligand-binding pocket (LBP) were substituted with Ser and Glu, respectively. The mutant failed to respond to ligand-induced homodimer or heterodimer transactivation (Figure S2) and showed reduced apoptotic responses to Sulindac (Figure 2G). Thus, RXRalpha is involved in Sulindac-induced apoptosis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 8249, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Bax, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, is required for the apoptotic effect of Sulindac. We therefore determined if RXRalpha was involved in activation of Bax by Sulindac. Sulindac induced cleavage of PARP (Figure 2H) and apoptosis (Figure 2I) in HCT116 colon cancer cells, but not HCT116 cells lacking Bax (Bax-/-). The fact that HCT116 cells are deficient of COX-2 demonstrates that Sulindac-induced apoptosis can be COX-2-independent. Immunoblotting assays showed that Bax underwent extensive oligomerization on mitochondria in response to Sulindac, which was abrogated by RXRalpha siRNA (Figure 2J). In addition, immunostaining using anti-Bax antibody (Bax/Delta21) and a Bax conformation-sensitive antibody Bax/6A7 demonstrated that Sulindac-induced Bax conformational change and mitochondrial targeting were impaired by RXRalpha siRNA (Figure 2K). Together, these results demonstrate that RXRalpha can act as an intracellular target mediating the apoptotic effect of Sulindac.
