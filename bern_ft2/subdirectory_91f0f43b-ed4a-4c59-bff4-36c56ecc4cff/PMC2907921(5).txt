Consistent with cytoplasmic localization of tRXRalpha (Figure S4A), immunostaining of MEFs with the DeltaN197 antibody revealed RXRalpha staining predominantly in the cytoplasm and occasionally on the plasma membrane (Figure 4B), likely due to the high levels of tRXRalpha in MEFs. Thus, deletion of the N-terminal sequences of RXRalpha could alter its subcellular localization, conferring its ability to interact with p85alpha.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 13505, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In an effort to study the regulation of tRXRalpha production, we found that expression of the N-terminal region of RXRalpha, RXRalpha/1-134, enhanced the tRXRalpha level (Figure S4B). To study the biological function of the endogenous tRXRalpha, we stably expressed RXRalpha/1-134 in HeLa cells, which resulted in production of a significant amount of 44-kDa tRXRalpha protein. Comparing to parental HeLa cells, HeLa/RXRalpha/1-134 stable clone had much higher AKT activation (Figure 4C) and were able to rapidly grow in soft agar (Figure 4D). Sulindac strongly reduced colonies formed by the stable clone in the colony formation assay (Figure 4E). Together, these results demonstrate that tRXRalpha may contribute to the growth and survival of cancer cells by activating AKT and that tRXRalpha-mediated activities can be negatively regulated by Sulindac.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 14361, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To study the possible pathological function of tRXRalpha, we examined its expression in tumor tissues. Immunoblotting of tissue samples showed the presence of tRXRalpha in breast and liver cancer tissues but not in tumor surrounding tissues or distant normal tissues from the same patients (Figure 4F). Previous studies revealed an extensive cytoplasmic RXRalpha immunostaining in malignant human prostatic tumor and thyroid tumor specimens. Immunohistochemical analysis using the DeltaN197 antibody also revealed a strong cytoplasmic RXRalpha staining in liver tumor tissue but not the surrounding tissue (Figure 4G), confirming that tRXRalpha produced in tumor tissues is cytoplasmic.

Also similar to tRXRalpha, RXRalpha/Delta80 interacted with p85alpha, which was strongly enhanced by TNFalpha (Figure 5A). In contrast, the full-length RXRalpha did not interact with p85alpha either in the absence or presence of TNFalpha, suggesting that the N-terminal sequences of RXRalpha prevented its binding to p85alpha. Interestingly, RXRalpha mutant lacking the N-terminal 100 amino acids (RXRalpha/Delta100) was unable to interact with p85alpha (Figure 5A). This was consistent with the fact that RXRalpha/1-134 but not RXRalpha/223-462 could interact with p85alpha (Figure 5B). The role of RXRalpha/Delta80 in AKT activation was demonstrated by that expression of RXRalpha/Delta80 but not RXRalpha/Delta100 strongly activated AKT in different cell types (Figure 5C). Consistent with cytoplasmic localization of tRXRalpha (Figures 4B and S4A), RXRalpha/Delta80 predominantly resided in the cytoplasm, with occasional punctate plasma membrane localization (Figure 5D). Thus, deletion of the N-terminal sequences of RXRalpha alters its subcellular localization and confers its ability to interact with p85alpha.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 16642, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To determine how tRXRalpha/p85alpha interaction induced AKT activation, we examined whether RXRalpha/Delta80 immunocomplex possessed PI3K activity in vitro. The PI3K activity exhibited by the Myc-RXRalpha/Delta80 immunocomplex was dramatically enhanced by TNFalpha treatment (Figures 5E and S5A-B), which correlated well with its ability to interact with p85alpha (Figure 5A) and activation of AKT (Figure 5C). Thus, TNFalpha-induced tRXRalpha/p85alpha interaction can activate the PI3K/AKT signaling.
