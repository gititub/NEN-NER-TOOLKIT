After 28 days, mice were monitored without any additional treatment. A Kaplan-Meier survival plot of mice with imatinib-resistant leukemia. Pumps either carried vehicle control (black line), 0.5 mM imatinib (IM, gray line), or 0.5 mM IODVA1 (IO1, lilac line). B Percentage of leukemic progenitors (EGFP+) B cells in peripheral blood (PB) was assessed by flow cytometry at the indicated week and plotted. Only IODVA1-treated mice remained alive for analysis at weeks 5, 7, and 10. C, D NSG mice engrafted with B-ALL patient sample 2018-136 were treated days 22-50 with vehicle (black line), IODVA1 (solid lilac line), dasatinib (solid cyan line), IODVA1 + dasatinib (dashed cyan line), ponatinib (solid blue line), IODVA1 + ponatinib (dashed blue line).

We confirmed that it does not target BCR-ABL1 by immuno-precipitating it from p190-BCR-ABL1-Ba/F3 cells treated with vehicle control, imatinib, or IODVA1 (3 muM) and probing its phosphotyrosine levels by immunoblotting. We also assessed levels of phospho-Crkl, a marker for BCR-ABL1 transformation and activity. Unlike imatinib, IODVA1 treatment did not affect the phosphorylation level of p190-BCR-ABL1 and of pCrkl (Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, the anti-proliferative activity of IODVA1 toward in vitro and in vivo BCR-ABL1 B-ALL models and its ability to eradicate residual disease cannot be explained by ABL1 inhibition. To further test this idea, we evaluated efficacy of IODVA1 in p210-BCR-ABL1(T315I) gatekeeper mutant leukemia model:one of the most common compound mutations arising in patients on imatinib therapy. While imatinib-treated mice died by day 22, before the end of the treatment (Fig. 2A, IM), 80% of IODVA1-treated mice survived until day 65, or 37 days post treatment withdrawal. In all, 60% of IODVA1-treated mice survived until the end of the experiment at day 80, or 52 days post treatment withdrawal (Fig. 2A, IO1). IODVA1 treatment alone significantly decreased leukemic progenitor levels by 24% by week 2, by 84% by week 5, and by 91% by week 10 (Fig. 2B).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 12278, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "IODVA1 decreases survival of patient-derived leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 12359, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Cells from PDX models representing pediatric Ph+, Ph-like, and MLL-rearranged B-ALL patients including patients with TKI-resistant BCR-ABL1(T315I) mutation (Supplementary Table S1) were found in general to be highly sensitive to IODVA1 ex vivo (Supplementary Fig. S3A-C). To validate these survival results in vivo, we transplanted patient 2018-136 cells with relapsed Ph+ (BCR-ABL1), IKZF1, DeltaCDKN2A/B, and DeltaPAX5 leukemia into NSG mice, stratified mice into six groups (five mice per group) post leukemic development and administered either vehicle, IODVA1 (4 mM), dasatinib or ponatinib (0.5 mM), and the IODVA1 + dasatinib or IODVA1 + ponatinib combinations via subcutaneous osmotic pumps for 4 weeks. Data show that all control group mice died at day 32 post transplantation, or 10 days post administration of the vehicle control (Fig. 2C). The dasatinib- and ponatinib-treated mice died by day 50 and 57, or 28 and 35 days after treatment began, respectively. Mice treated with IODVA1 survived until day 85, or 35 days post treatment withdrawal. There was no difference in survival between IODVA1 or IODVA1 + dasatinib-treated mice. The IODVA1 + ponatinib-treated mice survived until day 94, or 44 days post treatment withdrawal, showing that this combination is superior to IODVA1 alone (p = 0.0275). Unlike ponatinib or dasatinib monotherapies, PB leukemic progenitor cell counts dropped from 30.8 +- 2.8% at the beginning (day 22) to 12.5 +- 4.2% at the end of the treatment in IODVA1 monotherapy (day 50, Fig. 2D). This level was unchanged at day 60 but steadily increased after that to reach 41 +- 4.5% at day 82. The IODVA1 + ponatinib combination therapy was the most efficient at decreasing the leukemic progenitor levels to 4.0 +- 1.
