Consequently, a small-molecule inhibitor of RhoGEF can make an anti-cancer drug. We used cellular, mouse, and humanized models of RAC-dependent BCR-ABL1-driven and Ph-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia to identify VAV3, a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent RacGEF, as the target of the small molecule IODVA1. We show that through binding to VAV3, IODVA1 inhibits RAC activation and signaling and increases pro-apoptotic activity in BCR-ABL1-transformed cells. Consistent with this mechanism of action, cellular and animal models of BCR-ABL1-induced leukemia in Vav3-null background do not respond to IODVA1. By durably decreasing in vivo RAC signaling, IODVA1 eradicates leukemic propagating activity of TKI-resistant BCR-ABL1(T315I) B-ALL cells after treatment withdrawal. Importantly, IODVA1 suppresses the leukemic burden in the treatment refractory pediatric Ph+ and TKI-resistant Ph+ B-ALL patient-derived xenograft models better than standard-of-care dasatinib or ponatinib and provides a more durable response after treatment withdrawal. Pediatric leukemia samples with diverse genetic lesions show high sensitivity to IODVA1 ex vivo and this sensitivity is VAV3 dependent. IODVA1 thus spearheads a novel class of drugs that inhibits a RacGEF and holds promise as an anti-tumor therapy.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1639, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1652, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "RAC GTPases have been associated with pro-tumorigenic functions and development of cancer. They are pivotal in most aggressive types of leukemias and are characteristic of resistance to chemo-, radio-, and targeted-therapies and associated with persistence of leukemic stem cells. Reducing RAC activity specifically in cancer cells is desirable; however, no small-molecule inhibitor of RAC signaling is in clinical use despite many efforts.
