To test IODVA1's specificity, we repeated the pulldown assays with biotinylated IODVA1 (Fig. 4C) and checked by immunoblots if the RacGEFs VAV1 or PREX1 are present in the protein complexes on the neutravidin beads. We argued that if IODVA1 binds other proteins, VAV3 closest homologs, e.g., VAV1, are likely candidates. PREX1 was chosen because, like VAV-proteins, its activity is PIP3 regulated. Whereas VAV3 was concentrated on biotinylated IODVA1 beads, VAV1 and PREX1 were not even though they were clearly present in the p190-Ba/F3 and PDX 2018-136 cell lysates (Supplementary Fig. S5F). Together, our data show that Vav3-deficient leukemia progenitor cells do not respond to IODVA1 in cellular and in vivo assays while re-introducing VAV3 re-sensitizes them to IODVA1. The weaker response of the VAV3 DeltaCH mutant to IODVA1 suggests that the calponin homology domain regulates IODVA1's activity. Our data are consistent with the idea that VAV3 is IODVA1's target in vivo and in vitro.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31537, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "IODVA1 decreases the VAV3/RAC signaling axis in PDX models", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31596, "infons": {"file": "41375_2021_1455_Fig6_HTML.jpg", "id": "Fig6", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_title_caption"}, "text": "IODVA1 decreases the VAV3/RAC signaling pathway in vivo.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31653, "infons": {"file": "41375_2021_1455_Fig6_HTML.jpg", "id": "Fig6", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "A Bar graphs of pharmacodynamic assessment of leukemic progenitor cells (%) from the 2-week treated mice with vehicle control (black), imatinib (gray), or IODVA1 (lilac) from Fig. 2A using phospho-flow cytometry of the indicated RAC-dependent and -independent effectors. *p <= 0.05, **p <= 0.01, ***p <= 0.001 using one-way ANOVA with Dunnet's multiple comparison test.
