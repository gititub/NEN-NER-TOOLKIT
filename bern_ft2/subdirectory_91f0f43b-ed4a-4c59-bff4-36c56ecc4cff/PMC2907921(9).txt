Our observation that tRXRalpha mediates AKT activation by TNFalpha suggests a possibility of using Sulindac or analogs to suppress TNFalpha-induced AKT-mediated survival function, thereby shifting its function from survival to death. Consistently, we have provided evidence that Sulindac in combination with TNFalpha potently induce tRXRalpha-dependent caspase-8 activation and apoptosis, demonstrating that Sulindac was able to sensitize cancer cells to TNFalpha-induced death receptor-mediated extrinsic apoptotic pathway. The fact that TNFalpha-induced c-FLIP expression is completely prevented by Sulindac places c-FLIP in a central position for integrating TNFalpha-induced AKT activation and its inhibition by Sulindac and induction of apoptosis by Sulindac and TNFalpha combination.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29767, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our finding that RXRalpha serves as an intracellular target of Sulindac action provides a rationale to design RXRalpha-selective Sulindac derivatives for suppressing AKT activity. Our identification of a Sulindac analog, K-80003, with improved affinity to RXRalpha but lacking COX inhibitory effects offers an example to this approach. It is expected that K-80003 will lack or have much reduced COX-2-associated side effects. The fact that K-80003 could effectively inhibit the tRXRalpha pathway and the growth of cancer cells in vitro and in animals warrants its further development for cancer therapy.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30371, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30395, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Plasmids", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30404, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Flag-p85alpha, RXRalpha/F313S/R316E, RXRalpha/Delta80, and RXRalpha/Delta100 were constructed using standard methods.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30522, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Antibodies and Regents", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30545, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Antibodies for pAkt (Ser473, D9E), Bid, and cleaved caspase-8 (p43/p41)(Cell Signaling); Flag (M2), and Bax(6A7) (Sigma-Aldrich); p85alpha (Millipore); AKT1(C-20), GFP(B-2), Hsp60(N-20), c-Myc(9E10), RARgamma(C-19), RXRalpha(D20), RXRalpha(N197), Bax(Delta21), c-FLIP, PARP(H-250) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used.
