Therefore, finding a small-molecule inhibitor of RAC or of its upstream activator will provide an effective strategy for treatment of malignancies, especially leukemia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2262, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We recently identified the small molecule IODVA1, a 2-guanidinobenzimidazole derivative with anti-tumorigenic properties. Initial characterization of IODVA1 ruled out kinase inhibition potential but showed inhibition of RAC activity and signaling at low concentrations and within minutes of exposure. Here, we use in vitro and in vivo leukemic models of the chimeric BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ B-ALL) and Ph-like to reveal the mechanism of action of IODVA1. Expression of p190- or p210-BCR-ABL1 or Ph-like rearrangements activates RAC signaling pathways to regulate leukemogenesis and deleting RAC isoforms alone impairs leukemogenesis induced by p190- or p210-BCR-ABL1 expression in the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell compartment. Genetic deletion of the RAC guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RacGEF) VAV3 inhibits leukemic cell survival in vitro and in vivo and sensitizes lymphoblastic leukemia cells to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). In addition, despite tremendous success of TKIs in treating B-ALL in the clinic, the response is incomplete. Thus, there is an unmet need for novel treatment options for patients with TKI-resistant leukemia and treatments that prevent leukemic-cell persistence.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3511, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Here, we show that by binding to VAV3, IODVA1 inhibits RAC activation and its downstream signaling and induces apoptosis specifically in leukemic cells in vivo and in vitro. IODVA1 monotherapy is superior to ABL1-TKIs dasatinib or ponatinib in murine and pediatric patient-derived xenograft models of wild-type and TKI-resistant Ph+ BCR-ABL1. We also show that IODVA1 exerts anti-proliferative effects on samples derived from patients with relapsed and de novo ALL leukemias in a VAV3-dependent manner.
