In vitro, these cells showed sensitivity to IODVA1 and no sensitivity to dasatinib, the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib, or dasatinib/ruxolitinib combination (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Mice were stratified into four groups and administered either vehicle, IODVA1 (4 mM), ponatinib (0.5 mM), and the IODVA1 + ponatinib combination via osmotic pumps for 4 weeks after which treatment was stopped (Fig. 2E). Vehicle-treated mice died between day 25 and 34. Ponatinib-treated mice survived significantly longer but died before treatment ended between day 37 and 49. IODVA1-treated mice died between day 59 and 63, or 9 and 13 days after treatment ended. Interestingly, the IODVA1/ponatinib combination therapy increased animal survival the most as death occurred between day 77 and 78, or 27 and 28 days after treatment ended. Leukemic cell burden analysis (Fig. 2F) shows that ponatinib does not decrease levels of leukemic cells in the PB. IODVA1 on the other hand decreases the leukemic burden by 57%, from 21.0 +- 1.0% at the beginning of the treatment (day 21) to 9.0 +- 2.5% at the end of the treatment (day 50). However, the IODVA1-treated mice still die from leukemia as the leukemic burden increases to 43.1 +- 9.7% 8 days after treatment ended. The combo treatment decreased the leukemic burden 5.7-fold, from 21 +- 1.6% to 3.7 +- 1.6%, at the end of the treatment (day 50).

IODVA1 is specific to RAC (IC50 = 1 muM) and is less effective on CDC42 and not at all on RHOA (Supplementary Fig. S4A, B), consistent with our previous observations in MDA-MB-231 cells. As a result of decrease in activation of RAC, phosphorylation levels of downstream signaling molecules were decreased:JNK by 1.8-fold (p = 0.004), S6 by 1.5 (p = 0.
