Treatment with IODVA1 (IO1, 1 muM) reduced the number of live CD34+ cells expressing p190-BCR-ABL1, but not empty vector (Fig. 1A). Viability of p190-BCR-ABL1-, but not vector-transduced CD34+ cells decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). IODVA1 irreversibly inhibited the survival of p190- and p210-BCR-ABL1 but not of empty vector-expressing Ba/F3 cells with EC50 of 380 nM, NALM-1 cells with an EC50 of 680 nM and inhibited the colony-forming ability of BCR-ABL1-Ba/F3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A-D). Together, these results indicate that IODVA1 specifically targets proliferation and survival of BCR-ABL1-transformed cells and are consistent with our previous report that IODVA1 targets transformed cells.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6737, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "IODVA1 decreases in vivo leukemic burden and prevents leukemia-related death", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6814, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We next assessed in vivo efficacy of IODVA1 on a murine model of p190-BCR-ABL1-induced B-ALL and compared it to ABL1-TKI imatinib. C57Bl/10 mice were transplanted with p190-BCR-ABL1 low-density bone marrow (LDBM) cells, stratified into five groups post leukemia development, and administered either vehicle, 0.25 or 0.5 mM IODVA1, 0.5 mM imatinib, or the combination 0.25 mM IODVA1 + 0.5 mM imatinib via osmotic pumps. The low IODVA1 dose increased survival by an average of 10 days compared to vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 1C). Administration of imatinib, the higher IODVA1 dose, or the combination prevented leukemia-related death during treatment.

To determine if IODVA1 eradicates progenitor tumor-propagating capacity, as a functional surrogate of minimal residual disease capable of leukemia relapse, leukemic animals treated with vehicle, imatinib, 0.5 mM IODVA1, or the combination (Fig. 1C) were sacrificed and their BM cells were transplanted into secondary recipients in a limiting dilution series of 1 x 106, 0.3 x 106, and 0.1 x 106 cell doses and monitored for leukemia development and survival in the absence of any additional therapy. Data for the 106-cell dilution transplant indicate that administration of IODVA1 alone or in combination with imatinib resulted in survival of recipients beyond the 70-day endpoint analysis (Fig. 1D). Mice transplanted with BM cells from primary recipient mice treated with imatinib alone died by day 40 post transplantation. Analysis at week 5 post transplantation of the leukemic progenitor cells (EGFP+/B220+) from the PB of secondary transplant mice indicates that IODVA1 is better than imatinib at eradicating leukemic cell burden (Supplementary Fig. S1F).
