Here we report that Sulindac could bind to RXRalpha in the range of concentrations commonly used to study the anti-cancer effects of Sulindac. Conventional administration of Sulindac could result in about 10-15 muM Sulindac in the serum of patients and up to approximately 50 muM of Sulindac could be detected in the plasma of humans. Sulindac could be also concentrated in epithelial cells at concentrations that are at least 20-fold higher than those in the serum. Thus, the binding affinity of Sulindac to RXRalpha is relevant to in vivo cancer prevention by this drug. The facts that Sulindac can bind to RXRalpha and that the apoptotic effect of Sulindac largely depends on RXRalpha expression and its intact LBP strongly suggest that RXRalpha is an intracellular target of Sulindac.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25824, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "An important finding of this study is that the N-terminally truncated RXRalpha protein acts differently from the full-length RXRalpha protein. Cytoplasmic tRXRalpha interacted with p85alpha to activate the PI3K/AKT survival pathway and induce anchorage-independent cell growth in vitro and tumor growth in animals, implying that tRXRalpha may serve as an important tumor promoter. Our mutational analysis suggested that amino acids from 80 to 100 in RXRalpha are critical for tRXRalpha binding to p85alpha. The region is enriched with proline resides, which can presumably form several polyproline helices (PPII helix) known to bind to the SH3 domain that is present in p85alpha. The p85alpha-binding motif(s) in RXRalpha are likely masked by the N-terminal end sequences and regulated by phosphorylation. This is consistent with the regulation of tRXRalpha production and AKT activation by cell density. Regulated proteolysis is a key step in a number of different signaling pathways. Caspase-mediated cleavage of the BH3-only protein Bid into a truncated protein (tBid) and subsequent translocation of tBid to mitochondria are implicated in death receptor signaling, whereas proteolytic processing of Notch and nuclear translocation of truncated product are crucial steps in transduction of the Notch signaling. STAT signaling is also regulated by proteolytic processing. Thus, cleavage of RXRalpha may represent a mechanism that triggers nongenomic tRXRalpha signaling by removing the inhibitory N-terminal domain, allowing tRXRalpha to expose its p85alpha-binding motif and activate the PI3K/AKT signaling.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27435, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our finding that tRXRalpha is often produced in tumor tissues but not in normal tissues is consistent with previous findings that RXRalpha is cleaved in tumor but not in premalignant or normal tissues from patients with prostate or thyroid cancer. Thus, agents targeting tRXRalpha-mediated pathway can be effective and tumor specific. To this end, we showed that Sulindac could inhibit the tRXRalpha-mediated PI3K/AKT activation, suggesting that Sulindac represents a lead for a class of anti-cancer agents targeting this pathway.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27966, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our observation that Sulindac and TNFalpha synergistically inhibit tRXRalpha-dependent AKT activation provides insight into the crosstalk between retinoid receptor and TNFalpha signaling pathways. Retinoids in combination with cytokines, such as TNFalpha and TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL), can synergistically induce differentiation or apoptosis of human transformed cells whereas combination of retinoids and TNFalpha can overcome RA resistance. The fact that Sulindac and TNFalpha synergistically inhibit AKT activation in cancer cells implies that TNFalpha and probably other cytokines can prime cancer cells for their responsiveness to RXRalpha ligands such as Sulindac by converting AKT activation from a RXRalpha-independent to a RXRalpha-dependent manner.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28745, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "TNFalpha plays important roles in diverse cellular events such as cell survival and death.
