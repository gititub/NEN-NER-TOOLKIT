Thus, we conducted docking of Sulindac to three-dimensional structures of the RXRalpha LBD to identify strategies for structural modifications of Sulindac in order to dissociate its COX inhibition from RXRalpha-binding activity. Docking of Sulindac to RXRalpha (Figure 7A) showed that Sulindac bound in a mode where its carboxylate group was aligned with the carboxylate group found in all RXRalpha ligands examined (Figure 7B), interacting with Arg316 in the RXRalpha LBP. The benzyl methyl sulfide portion of Sulindac bound to the hydrophobic region of the RXRalpha LBP, overlapping with the a-ionone ring of 9-cis-RA. In this binding mode, Van der Waals interaction of the -SCH3 group at position 4 (Figure 7C) with the RXRalpha protein was not optimal and there was room around it for modification to improve the binding to RXRalpha. The idea of making use of position 4 to design RXRalpha-selective analogs was fully supported by the fact that sulindac prodrug, sulindac sulfoxide and the metabolite sulindac sulfone show no COX-inhibiting activity, whereas the metabolite sulindac sulfide (used in this study) is a potent COX inhibitor. As shown in Figure 7A, the carboxylate group of Sulindac was positioned away from Arg316 compared to the equivalent ones in RXRalpha ligands DHA, BMS649, and 9-cis-RA. Replacing -CH2COOH at position D with a bulkier group such as -CH2CH2COOH would help place the carboxylate group closer to Arg316 to achieve good charge-charge interaction with RXRalpha as observed in 9-cis-RA. Our candidate compounds were also examined by docking to the crystal structure of COX-2 (Figure S7) to identify non-COX binders. Based on these considerations, five analogs were designed and synthesized (Figures 7C and S7). Their evaluation showed that all analogs retained RXRalpha-binding activity, with K-80003 being the most potent, likely due to its iso-propyl (i-Pr) group at position 4, which has improved interaction with the hydrophobic residues on Helix7 of RXRalpha. Significantly, K-80003 and K-80005 had no detectable inhibition of COX activities and failed to inhibit constitutive and TNFalpha or IL-1beta-induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production (Figures 7C, D, and data not shown). The binding of K-80003 to RXRalpha was also confirmed by 19F NMR binding assays (Figure 7E). Thus, Sulindac's RXRalpha-binding can be dissociated from its COX-binding.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23456, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "RXRalpha-selective Analog K-80003 is a Potent Inhibitor of AKT Activation and Cancer Cell Growth", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23553, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Because of its much-improved affinity to RXRalpha and lack of COX inhibitory effect, K-80003 was chosen for further evaluation. Immunoblotting showed that K-80003 was much more effective than Sulindac in inhibiting RA- and TNFalpha-induced AKT activation (Figures 8A and S8). Figure 8B shows that the inhibitory effect of K-80003 on AKT activation in PC3 cells is largely impaired by reducing RXRalpha, but not RARgamma, expression by siRNA. Thus, inhibition of AKT activation by K-80003 was also dependent on RXRalpha expression. The interaction of RXRalpha/Delta80 with p85alpha either in the absence or presence of TNFalpha was more potently inhibited by K-80003 than by Sulindac (Figure 8C). K-80003 was also more effective than Sulindac in inducing PARP cleavage when used together with TNFalpha in ZR-75-1 cells (Figure 8D). Similar to Sulindac, K-80003 combination with TNFalpha synergistically induced PARP cleavage and caspase-8 activation (Figure 8E). In clonogenic survival assays, colony formation of HeLa/RXRalpha/1-134 and RXRalpha/Delta80 cells was almost completely suppressed by K-80003 (Figure 8F). Significantly, K-80003 exhibited much more potent inhibitory effect than Sulindac on the growth of RXRalpha/Delta80 tumor in animals (Figure 8G). Together, the RXRalpha-selective Sulindac analog K-80003 is a potent inhibitor of RXRalpha-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling and cancer cell growth.
