Our biochemical assays show that IODVA1 does not stimulate the activity of the RAC negative regulators p50GAP and RhoGDI1 (Supplementary Fig. S4E-G), so we turned to positive regulators GEFs and posited that IODVA1 inhibits one RAC-specific GEF leading to its inactivation. While several RacGEFs have been associated with leukemogenesis, VAV3 was shown to play a central role. We thus focused on VAV3 and tested if IODVA1 inhibits VAV3 binding to RAC. p190-BCR-ABL1 or empty vector-expressing Ba/F3 were treated with IODVA1 (3 muM) or vehicle control, subjected to GST-RAC pulldown and immunoblotted for pVAV3 and VAV3 (Fig. 4A). There was no significant change in levels of VAV3 or pVAV3 bound to RAC in empty vector-expressing Ba/F3 cells regardless of the treatment (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). Consistent with previous studies, expressing p190-BCR-ABL1 increased levels of pVAV3 by 3.2-fold in vehicle-treated cells and binding between pVAV3 and RAC (Fig. 4A, input lane 3 and pulldown lane 3). IODVA1 treatment of cells expressing p190-BCR-ABL1 decreased levels of overall pVAV3 by 4-fold (Fig. 4A, input lane 4). This decrease is accompanied by a reduced binding of pVAV3/VAV3 to RAC (Fig. 4A, pulldown lane 4). Thus, our data suggest that IODVA1 inhibits overall VAV3 activation leading to a decreased binding to and activation of RAC in BCR-ABL1-expressing cells.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 23611, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We then measured the binding affinity (Kd) of IODVA1 to recombinant VAV3 and RAC1 using microscale thermophoresis (MST) with catalytic domain (DH/PH) of RhoGEF LARG serving as negative control.

Both cell lysates contained detectable levels of VAV3 as detected by immunoblotting that was concentrated 5-7 folds on biotinylated IODVA1 while the empty beads did not bind any VAV3 (lanes 1-3). Free IODVA1 (1-10 muM) was able to compete VAV3 binding to the biotinylated immobilized IODVA1 in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 4-6). Next, we repeated the same experiment but with recombinant RAC2 and N-VAV3 lacking the C-terminus SRC-homology domains. Biotinylated IODVA1 but not empty beads pulled N-VAV3 but not RAC2 and the addition of IODVA1 dissociated N-VAV3 from the conjugated beads (Fig. 4C).

We argued that if IODVA1 targets VAV3, then Vav3-/- cells should be less sensitive to IODVA1. Wild-type or Vav3-/- murine BM leukemic cells expressing p190-BCR-ABL1 (EGFP+/B220+) were subjected to colony-forming assay in the presence of IODVA1 (Fig. 4D). The number of colonies formed by wild-type leukemic cells expressing Vav3 (mean +- SD of 72 +- 9.5) decreased on average by 2.4- and 7-fold in the presence of 1 and 3 muM IODVA1 (30 +- 9.2 and 12 +- 2.5), respectively. Vav3-/- leukemic BM cells on the other hand formed similar number of colonies when grown in the presence of vehicle control (20 +- 3.1) or IODVA1 (20 +- 2.5 and 15 +- 7.5) suggesting they lost sensitivity to our drug. We did not observe significant difference in the number of colonies formed by Vav3-/- leukemic cells and by IODVA1-treated wild-type leukemic cells. Similarly, cell-cycle analysis shows that Vav3-/- cells expressing p190-BCR-ABL1 were not affected by IODVA1 (Fig. 4E).
