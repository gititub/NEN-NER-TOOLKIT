Here we report that Sulindac, an NSAID, induces apoptosis by binding to retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXRalpha). We identified an N-terminally-truncated RXRalpha (tRXRalpha) in several cancer cell lines and primary tumors, which interacted with the p85alpha subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K). Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) promoted tRXRalpha interaction with the p85alpha, activating PI3K/AKT signaling. When combined with TNFalpha, Sulindac inhibited TNFalpha-induced tRXRalpha/p85alpha interaction, leading to activation of the death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway. We designed and synthesized a Sulindac analog K-80003, which has increased affinity to RXRalpha but lacks COX inhibitory activity. K-80003 displayed enhanced efficacy in inhibiting tRXRalpha-dependent AKT activation and tRXRalpha tumor growth in animals.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1100, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title"}, "text": "SIGNIFICANCE", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1113, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our results demonstrate that RXRalpha mediates NSAID Sulindac-induced apoptosis. We provide evidence that tRXRalpha detected in cancer cells acts nongenomically to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway and promote cancer cell growth and survival, which is inhibited by Sulindac. Our finding that Sulindac and TNFalpha synergistically induce apoptosis through activation of TNFalpha-dependent apoptotic pathway offers therapeutic strategies to sensitize cancer cells to the killing effect of this cytokine. Our characterizations of RXR-selective Sulindac-derived analog K-80003 demonstrate that Sulindac's anti-cancer effects can be dissociated from its COX inhibition and identify a RXRalpha-based lead for cancer therapy. These findings should appeal to a broad audience of clinicians, cancer biologists, molecular biologists and drug designers.
