We then examined the effect of RXRalpha/Delta80 on the growth of cancer cells in animals by injecting the same number of RXRalpha/Delta80 expressing cells and the control cells into different flanks of same nude mice. Our results showed that tumors formed by SW480/RXRalpha/Delta80 and HCT116/RXRalpha/Delta80 grew much faster than those formed by the control cells (Figures 5H-I).

Indeed, Sulindac/TNFalpha-induced PARP cleavage was inhibited by the expression of a constitutive-active AKT (CA-AKT) and enhanced by the expression of a dominant-negative AKT (DN-AKT) (Figure 6F). Consistently, induction of apoptosis and activation of caspase-8 and Bax by Sulindac/TNFalpha combination was inhibited by CA-AKT (Figures 6G, 6H, and S6E). To study how Sulindac promoted apoptosis through its inhibition of AKT, we examined the expression of c-FLIP, a downstream target gene of AKT signaling, which acts as a potent inhibitor of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway by inhibiting caspase-8 activation. Treatment of cells with TNFalpha resulted in strong induction of both short form (c-FLIPS) and long form (c-FLIPL) of c-FLIP, which was inhibited by Sulindac (Figure 6I). Thus, Sulindac might induce apoptosis by suppressing the inducing effect of TNFalpha on c-FLIP expression.
