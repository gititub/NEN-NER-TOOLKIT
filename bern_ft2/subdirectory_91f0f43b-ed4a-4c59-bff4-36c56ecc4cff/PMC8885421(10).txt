Human cord blood CD34+ cells were used as negative control as they were not sensitive to IODVA1 and do not have high levels of pVAV3. Levels of pVAV3 and pPAK1 were not detectable in weakly responsive Ph+ PDX cells 2017-58 and Ph-like 2018-132 cells regardless of the treatment. pVAV1 levels on the other hand were unchanged by IODVA1 in any of the patient samples tested. Similarly, the pVAV3/VAV3 levels of Ph-like PDX 2016-79 and 2018-132 cells with the same (IGH-CLRF2; JAK2) mutations correlate with their response to IODVA1 (Supplementary Fig. S3B, D) and are consistent with levels of pVAV3/VAV3 being a biomarker for IODVA1 response.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 35016, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To further confirm the effect on VAV3/RAC/PAK pathway in the 2018-136 and 2017-129 PDX models, we checked levels of pVAV3 and pPAK1/2 in BM cell aspirates of vehicle and IODVA1 + ponatinib-treated mice from the two PDX models (Fig. 6C). pVAV3 levels are high in vehicle-treated mice at the time of death but pVAV3 was hardly detectable in IODVA1 + ponatinib-treated mice at the end of treatment (day 50).

We compared levels of pVAV3 in BM of PDX 2018-136 mice treated with dasatinib or IODVA1 (Supplementary Fig. S5G). IODVA1, but not dasatinib significantly decreased VAV3 activation.

Best therapeutic approaches combining chemotherapy, ABL1-TKIs, and immunotherapy proved to be only partly effective in Ph+ B-ALL patients. The relative failure of TKI therapy is due, among others, to development of resistance-inducing mutations, such as ABL1-T315I and to recurrent somatic alterations in key signaling pathways such as the RAS/ERK, PI3K/AKT, B-cell development and differentiation, RAC/PAK, and Janus kinases. IODVA1 has superior potency against pediatric patient samples with Ph+ B-ALL including TKI-resistant BCR-ABL1(T315I) than currently administered therapies. Its success in patient samples of Ph-like and MLL rearrangements (Supplementary Fig. S3) illustrates its effect in a variety of tyrosine kinase receptors. Thus, IODVA1 is well suited to treat Ph+ and Ph-like and probably other leukemias with a superior suppression of growth and survival.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 37197, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "VAV3 is a multi-domain tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent RacGEF that functions downstream of several different signaling molecules including immune response receptors, G-protein-coupled receptors, protein tyrosine kinases, and integrins and is a critical component of BCR-ABL1-induced RAC activation. Thus far, no small-molecule inhibitor of VAV3 has been reported. If the small-molecule EHop-016 was shown to inhibit the VAV1/RAC1 interaction, it is not clear if it targets VAV1 directly. Our data show that IODVA1 binds tightly to VAV3 (Kd = 512 nM, Fig. 4B, C), prevents its activation, and the activation of RAC in vitro and in vivo. In accordance with this mechanism of action, IODVA1 significantly decreases the survival of genetically diverse PDX B-ALL cells in a VAV3-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Fig. 6B). One can argue that IODVA1 inhibits BCR-ABL1 or the transmembrane or cytosolic protein tyrosine kinases responsible for VAV3 phosphorylation; however, this is unlikely since IODVA1 is not a kinase inhibitor and BCR-ABL1 phosphorylation levels or activity are not affected by IODVA1 (Supplementary Fig. S2).
