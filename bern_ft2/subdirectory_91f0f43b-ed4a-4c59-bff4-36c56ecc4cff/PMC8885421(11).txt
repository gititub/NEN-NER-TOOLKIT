IODVA1 targeting of VAV3 seems specific as it has no effect on Vav3-/- cells in vitro or in vivo. The possibility that IODVA1 inhibits the homologous VAV1/2 exists but based on the loss of IODVA1's efficacy in Vav3-/- models (Fig. 4C-E), its inability to affect VAV1 phosphorylation levels in primary patient cells (Fig. 6B), or its inability to interact with VAV1 (Supplementary Fig. S5F), this inhibition is unlikely. Significantly, IODVA1 has no effect on Vav3-/- murine BM leukemic cells and does not affect the survival of a mouse model of Vav3-/- p190-BCR-ABL1-induced leukemia. In addition, IODVA1 has no effect on Rac1Delta/Delta+Rac2-/- leukemic cells (Fig. 3D). These in vivo and in vitro results suggest that off-target effect on another RacGEF is unlikely, as increases in mouse survival or cell proliferation were not detected.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 39188, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our in vitro cell cycle and colony formation data indicate that IODVA1 phenocopies genetic deletion of VAV3 (Fig. 4D, E), consistent with no off-target effects. The IODVA1-triggered increase in apoptosis (Figs. 3C and 4E) is also in line with the increase in apoptosis observed in Vav3-/- leukemic cells. Results from the colony formation assays with the Rac1Delta/Delta+Rac2-/- leukemic cells (Fig. 3D) are also consistent with this idea. The colony formation assays (Figs. 3D and 4D) and the VAV3 rescue experiments (Fig. 5C) point to the importance of the VAV3/RAC pathway in the pathophysiology of Ph+ leukemias. We noticed, however, that the Rac1Delta/Delta+Rac2-/- leukemic cells resulted in higher number of colonies than cells treated with IODVA1. This can be explained by residual Rac1 (Supplementary Fig. S4D), which is pro cell proliferation or by the RAC-independent pathways regulated by VAV3 that are not inhibited by IODVA1. Likewise, there is a noticeable difference between IODVA1's pharmacological action in vivo, which increases survival of leukemic mice, and VAV3 genetic deletion, which results in premature leukemic mice death (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Our phospho-flow cytometric data show, however, that in the background of Vav3-/-, BCR-ABL1 leukemic cells increase AKT and STAT3 pathway signaling (Supplementary Fig. S5C, D), which may be the mechanism of adaptation responsible for LSC proliferation and death of Vav3-/- leukemic mice (see also).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 40662, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "VAV3 can be roughly divided into two halves: (1) a RAC-binding N-terminal half and a (2) C-terminal adaptor module (Fig. 5A). Cell stimulation releases autoinhibition by the N-terminal calponin homology CH-domain and acidic stretch (Ac) and the C-terminal SH3 domain via phosphorylation of conserved Tyr-residues (e.g., Tyr173), thus allowing GTPase access to the DH domain. Based on our biochemical data (Figs. 4A, B and 6B and Supplementary Fig. S6B), we argue that IODVA1 inhibits VAV3 phosphorylation by preventing the access of tyrosine residues in the Ac-stretch to SRC kinases. We postulate that IODVA1 likely locks VAV3 into the autoinhibitory state, thus preventing RAC from accessing the DH domain for activation. Consistent with this picture are our rescue data with the DeltaCH mutant of VAV3, which unlike full-length VAV3, lost its sensitivity to IODVA1 (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that the VAV3 calponin homology domain is part of IODVA1 binding site. The pulldown with biotinylated IODVA1 (Fig. 4C) suggests that the C-terminal SH2/SH3 domains are dispensable for IODVA1 binding. Dissection of the VAV3/IODVA1 interaction and precise mapping of the binding site are currently underway.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 41867, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In conclusion, we have shown that pharmacological inhibition of VAV3 by IODVA1 in preclinical models is therapeutically superior to inhibiting upstream kinases and thus an attractive therapeutic strategy to treat Ph+ and TKI-resistant Ph+ B-ALL. This strategy should benefit other malignancies where VAV3 is a target. We thus expect IODVA1 to have a broader therapeutic application. In addition, IODVA1 constitutes an exceptional tool to dissect the VAV3/RAC signaling axis. Broadly, RhoGEFs are multi-domain proteins that are regulated by autoinhibition. Consequently, small molecules that stabilize the autoinhibited conformation of RhoGEFs and inhibit their activity could be developed into drugs to treat human cancers.
