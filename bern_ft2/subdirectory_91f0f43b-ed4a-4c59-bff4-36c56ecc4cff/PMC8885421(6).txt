The decrease in PAK and BAD phosphorylation suggests that IODVA1 promotes reduction in survival and induction of apoptosis. To further test this hypothesis, we analyzed the cell cycle of p190-BCR-ABL1 leukemic progenitor cells (EGFP+/B220dim) treated with vehicle control or IODVA1 (1-10 muM) (Fig. 3C). IODVA1 did not affect the G0+G1 phase but significantly changed the distribution of the G2+M, S, and apoptotic phases. It increased the percentage of cells in the G2+M phases, reduced the S-phase 8-fold (p = 0.005) and increased apoptosis by at least 5.3 times. Therefore, IODVA1 increases percentage of cells in G2/M phase, induces S-phase arrest, and increases apoptosis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19380, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "RAC-deficient cells do not respond to IODVA1", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19425, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To confirm that IODVA1 targets RAC-dependent pathways, we assessed its effects in a Rac2-null background. Rac1Delta/Delta+Rac2-/- murine cells, which show severe reduction in RAC1 expression and are deficient in RAC2 (Supplementary Fig. S4D), and wild-type cells were transduced with p190-BCR-ABL1 and tested for colony-forming ability in the presence of IODVA1 (Fig. 3D). IODVA1 significantly inhibited colony-forming ability of wild-type but not Rac1Delta/Delta+Rac2-/- leukemic cells, suggesting that they are insensitive to IODVA1. Rac1Delta/Delta+Rac2-/- leukemic cells treated with vehicle or IODVA1 formed 2.4 times more colonies than wild-type leukemic cells treated with IODVA1.
