We therefore investigated whether Sulindac activated Bax through inhibition of AKT activation and found that Sulindac potently suppressed AKT activation in HCT116 and other cancer cell lines (Figure 3A). Transfection of RXRalpha siRNA significantly reduced AKT activation (Figure 3B), similar to the effect of Sulindac, raising the possibility that Sulindac might inhibit RXRalpha-mediated AKT activation. Although Sulindac failed to inhibit AKT activation induced by epidermal growth factor (Figure S3A), it potently inhibited AKT activation induced by retinoic acid in a RXRalpha-dependent manner (Figures S3B-C).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 10063, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "TNFalpha could also activate PI3K/AKT signaling. We thus examined whether RXRalpha played a role in AKT activation by TNFalpha. Treatment of A549 lung cancer cells with TNFalpha led to strong AKT activation, which was potently inhibited by Sulindac (Figure 3C). Transfection of RXRalpha siRNA, which inhibited not only the expression of the 54-kDa fl-RXRalpha but also a 44-kDa tRXRalpha, significantly impaired the ability of TNFalpha to activate AKT (Figure 3C), demonstrating that RXRalpha was critical for AKT activation by TNFalpha. Although Sulindac showed little inhibitory effect on AKT activation in cancer cells with high basal AKT activation, such as ZR-75-1 breast cancer and PC3 prostate cancer cells, it completely inhibited AKT activation when used together with TNFalpha (Figure 3D), raising an intriguing possibility that TNFalpha can sensitize cancer cells to Sulindac by converting AKT activation from a RXRalpha-independent to a RXRalpha-dependent manner.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 11039, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "TNFalpha-induced Interaction of tRXRalpha with p85alpha and Its Inhibition by Sulindac", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 11126, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our observations that RXRalpha was required for AKT activation by TNFalpha and retinoic acid prompted us to examine whether RXRalpha interacted with p85alpha. Our initial intensive attempts by co-immunoprecipitation assays using anti-RXRalpha antibody (D20) against sequences in the N-terminus of RXRalpha (Figure 3E) failed to detect a clear interaction, although the antibody effectively immunoprecipitated the RXRalpha protein (Figure S3E). As tRXRalpha proteins produced through limited proteolytic cleavage in cancer cells were cytoplasmic, we asked whether the cytoplasmic tRXRalpha was responsible for binding to p85alpha. For this purpose, we used another anti-RXRalpha antibody (DeltaN197) that recognizes the RXRalpha LBD (Figure 3F). Indeed, p85alpha was readily co-immunoprecipitated by the DeltaN197 antibody in a TNFalpha (Figure 3E) or RA (Figures S3D-E) dependent manner. Co-immunoprecipitation of p85alpha was accompanied with immunoprecipitation of tRXRalpha, which was not detected by the D20 RXRalpha antibody (Figure S3E), indicating its lack of N-terminal sequences. Using the DeltaN197 antibody, we also observed that interaction of p85alpha with tRXRalpha in the presence of TNFalpha (Figure 3E) or 9-cis-RA (Figure S3D) was inhibited by Sulindac. These results suggested that tRXRalpha might bind to p85alpha, leading to AKT activation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 12488, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Regulation of tRXRalpha Production and Its Activation of AKT", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 12549, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We reported previously that cell density plays a critical role in determining the cytoplasmic localization of RARgamma. We similarly observed that the level of the 44-kDa tRXRalpha reduced as the density of cells increased, which was accompanied with appearance of a smaller RXRalpha fragment. Interestingly, the levels of the 44-kDa tRXRalpha protein correlated with AKT activation (Figure 4A), suggesting that cell density-dependent proteolytic cleavage of RXRalpha might be an important mechanism regulating AKT activation.
