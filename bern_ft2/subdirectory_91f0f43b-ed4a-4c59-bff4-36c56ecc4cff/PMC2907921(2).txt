The discovery that regular use of aspirin, an NSAID, reduce the incidence of colon cancer has provided the impetus to develop NSAIDs for cancer prevention and treatment. Sulindac has received extensive attention because of its potent induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cancer cell growth. NSAIDs are believed to exert their anti-cancer effects through inhibition of COX-2, which is often overexpressed in human premalignant and malignant tissues and plays a role in carcinogenesis. Compelling evidence however also indicates that NSAIDs can function through COX-2-independent mechanisms. For example, cells lacking COX-1, COX-2, or both show comparable sensitivity to NSAID-induced apoptosis, whereas NSAIDs that do not inhibit COX-2 also induce apoptosis and inhibit carcinogenesis. Recent evidence that COX-2 inhibition is associated with increased cardiovascular risk underscores the importance in the identification of non-COX-2 targets, which may lead to strategies for developing improved anti-cancer drugs. Although several non-COX-2 targets for NSAIDs have been reported, more efforts to identify additional targets and characterize their mechanism of action are needed in order to develop improved target-based drugs for cancer therapy.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3810, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXRalpha), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, plays a role in many biological processes including carcinogenesis. 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), several polyunsaturated fatty acids, and the NSAID Etodolac can bind to RXRalpha to regulate different biological functions. Targretin, a synthetic RXR ligand, is currently used for treating cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, demonstrating the suitability of targeting RXRalpha for cancer therapy. Consistently, the oncogenic potential of RXRalpha has been demonstrated. Genetic disruption of RXRalpha enhances tumorigenesis, and RXR binding to PML/RAR is essential for the development of acute promeylocytic leukemia. In addition, the RXRalpha protein level is often reduced in cancer cells and tumor tissues, which is in part due to limited proteolytic processing of RXRalpha by calpain or cathepsin. However, the biological function of the resulting truncated RXRalpha (tRXRalpha) proteins remains unknown.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4796, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The mechanisms by which RXRalpha regulates diverse biological functions remain to be fully determined and are expected to be complex. Like other nuclear receptors, RXRalpha is known to regulate the transcription of target genes by binding to DNA response elements. Accumulating evidence however indicates that RXRalpha may also have extranuclear actions. Thus, RXRalpha resides in the cytoplasm in certain cell types and at different stages during development. It migrates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to differentiation, apoptosis, and inflammation. Interestingly, tRXRalpha resulted from limited proteolytic cleavage in tumor cells is also cytoplasmic. Whether and how it acts in the cytoplasm to modulate carcinogenesis is currently unknown.
