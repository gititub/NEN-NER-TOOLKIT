Histological normal specimens, which were about at least 3~5 cm distant from the tumor nodule, were obtained from the corresponding patients. The study was approved by Xiamen University Institute for Biomedical Research Ethics Committee, and all of the patients gave informed consent. Tissues with primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, n=6) or breast cancer (n=6) were collected for detecting the expression of RXRalpha using DeltaN197 antibody. For immunohistochemistry analysis, tissue sections were incubated with the DeltaN197 antibody (1:500) overnight at 4 C and detected with goat anti-rabbit-specific immunoglobulins (1:100). The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34401, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "COX Assays", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 34412, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "COX Fluorescent Activity Assay, COX Fluorescent Inhibitor Screening Assay and Prostaglandin E2 Enzyme Immunoassay Kits were from Cayman Chemical.
