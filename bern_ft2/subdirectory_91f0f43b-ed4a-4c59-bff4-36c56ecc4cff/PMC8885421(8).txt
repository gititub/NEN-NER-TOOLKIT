We expressed full-length VAV3, the dominant active DeltaCH mutant or the N369A exchange-deficient mutant in Vav3-/- p190-BCR-ABL1-transformed murine BM leukemic cells and analyzed cell-cycle changes post vehicle or IODVA1 treatment (Fig. 5A, B). Full-length VAV3 but not the empty vector re-sensitized the Vav3-/- BM leukemic cells to IODVA1 as shown by a 5.8-fold increase in apoptosis (p = 0.008) and a 15% decrease (p = 0.02) in cells in the S-phase at 10 muM. The DeltaCH or the GEF-activity deficient mutants did not re-sensitize Vav3-/- leukemic cells to IODVA1 even at the highest concentration. In addition, we performed the rescue experiments using the colony-forming assay in the presence of IODVA1 (1, 5, and 10 muM) or vehicle control (Fig. 5C). Re-introducing full-length or DeltaCH VAV3 results in similar number of colonies as with wild-type BM leukemic cells (black bars, mean of 200.3 and 183.3 vs 188.3, respectively), a 3-fold increase from Vav3-/- leukemic cells expressing the empty vector (mean = 64.3 colonies). Re-introducing the GEF-deficient mutant has no effect on the colony formation ability of Vav3-/- leukemic cells (mean = 63.3 colonies) consistent with the importance of sustained Rac activity for proliferation of leukemic cells. Importantly, Vav3-/- leukemic cells expressing VAV3 respond to IODVA1 in a dose-dependent manner. At 10 muM IODVA1, the number of colonies made by Vav3-/- cells expressing full-length VAV3 is reduced by a third and becomes like that made by Vav3-/- expressing empty vector (gray bars, 75 vs 66 colonies). On the other hand, DeltaCH and GEF-deficient mutants expressing leukemic cells are not sensitive to IODVA1. Taken together, the cell-cycle and proliferation experiments show that exogenous expression of VAV3 in Vav3-/- leukemic cells increases their dependency on VAV3 GEF-dependent proliferative pathways and re-sensitizes them to IODVA1. The reduced sensitivity of the DeltaCH mutant to IODVA1 suggests that this domain is part of its binding site on VAV3.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29755, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Next, we tested if the lack of response to IODVA1 by Vav3-/- cells holds in vivo. We used wild-type or Vav3-/- LDBM cells in p190-BCR-ABL1 transplantation model and treated mice as before. IODVA1 did not have any effect on the survival of Vav3-/- leukemic mice supporting the hypothesis that VAV3 is IODVA1's target in vivo (Supplementary Fig. S5A). The persistency of leukemia in vivo in Vav3-/- chimeras suggests that Vav3-/- BCR-ABL1 leukemia has evolved mechanisms of escape relying on RAC-independent pathways such as STAT3 signaling pathways (Supplementary Fig. S5B-D).
