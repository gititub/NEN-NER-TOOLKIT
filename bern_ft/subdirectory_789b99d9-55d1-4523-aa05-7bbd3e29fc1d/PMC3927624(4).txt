In a subgroup analysis of AFFIRM data, patients with very active MS (>2 relapses in previous year and Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline) had reductions of 81% in ARR, and 53% and 64% reduction in sustained (12 and 24 weeks, respectively) disability progression with natalizumab. Equivalent figures for fingolimod were 63% and 22%. Five times more patients were free from disease activity with natalizumab versus placebo (37% vs. 7%) compared with 2.5 times for fingolimod (33% vs. 13%).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 9892, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The efficacy of natalizumab reported from the clinical trials is supported by real-world data. The Tysabri Observational Program (TOP) is an open-label, observational study being conducted in Europe, Australia and Canada, with 3976 patients from 15 countries enrolled by December 2011. The ARR was reduced from 1.99 (95% CI 1.96-2.03) at baseline to 0.26 (95% CI 0.23-0.30; p < 0.0001) after 3 months of natalizumab treatment and was maintained at that rate at 4 years. EDSS was stable over 4 years, in both patients with a high (4.5) or low (2.0) starting median EDSS, and more patients had confirmed improvement rather than disability progression. In the TYNERGY study, natalizumab was prescribed in a real-life setting, and the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC) showed a reduction in 9.0 points (p < 0.0001) after 12 months, corresponding to a reduction from severe to moderate fatigue. Scores for quality of life, sleepiness, depression, cognition and disability progression were all improved from baseline (all p < 0.0001), and walking speed as measured by the 6-minute walk-test also increased at month 12 (p = 0.0016). In the Swedish IMSE (Immunomodulation and Multiple Sclerosis Epidemiology) study, a significant improvement in Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) score (from 49.7 to 55.6; p < 0.05) was seen over 24 months' natalizumab treatment. In a Belgian cohort, natalizumab increased freedom from disease activity in relapsing-remitting MS patients after previous therapy failure, with 62% being free of disease activity after 44 weeks.

In an Italian cohort of 55 patients (mean age 14.4 years), significant improvement in mean EDSS scores was reported (from 2.7 to 1.9 at the last visit; p < 0.001). Similarly, in a Spanish cohort of nine patients (mean age 15.3 years), eight demonstrated a median improvement in EDSS score from 3.0 to 1.0, and a reduction in median ARR from 3.0 to 0. Natalizumab also appears to be generally well tolerated in this patient population.
