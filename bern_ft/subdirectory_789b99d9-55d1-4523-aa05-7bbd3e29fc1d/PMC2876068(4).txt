As expected, cell lines with BRAFV600E mutation had a fast (detectable at 1 hour) and sustained (persistent at 20 hours, Figure 1B) inhibition of pErk, although one of the cell lines (M263) had lower inhibition of pErk than the rest. There was no pErk inhibition in two cell lines with NRAS Q61L mutation (M202 and M207) and a cell line wild type for both oncogenes (M257). In fact, there was a markedly increased pErk signal in one NRAS Q61L mutated cell line (M207), an observation consistent with data from others that has been attributed to loss of negative regulatory pathways and enhanced signaling through C-Raf. Therefore, PLX4032 inhibits MAPK pathway signaling specifically in cell lines that harbor the BRAFV600E mutation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 11233, "infons": {"file": "T1.xml", "id": "T1", "section_type": "TABLE", "type": "table_caption"}, "text": "Genomic characterization, growth kinetics and sensitivity towards PLX4032 for a panel of human melanoma cell lines.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 11349, "infons": {"file": "T1.xml", "id": "T1", "section_type": "TABLE", "type": "table", "xml": "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<table frame=\"hsides\" rules=\"groups\"><thead><tr><th align=\"left\">Cell Line</th><th align=\"left\">NRAS/BRAF</th><th align=\"center\">Number of <italic>BRAF </italic>Gene Copies</th><th align=\"left\">Other Oncogenic Events</th><th align=\"center\">Cell line doubling time (hours)</th><th align=\"left\">PLX4032 IC<sub>50 </sub>(muM)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align=\"left\">M257</td><td align=\"left\">Wild type</td><td align=\"center\">3</td><td align=\"left\"><italic>CDKN2A </italic>R80</td><td align=\"center\">31.4</td><td align=\"left\">Not reached</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"6\"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align=\"left\">M202</td><td align=\"left\"><italic>NRAS </italic>Q61L</td><td align=\"center\">2</td><td align=\"left\"><italic>EGFR </italic>amplification<break/><italic>CDKN2A </italic>homozygous deletion</td><td align=\"center\">26.
