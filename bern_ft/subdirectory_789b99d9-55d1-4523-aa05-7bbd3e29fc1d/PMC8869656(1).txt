The global diabetic crisis has not abated despite the introduction of new types of drugs and targets. Persistent unaddressed patient needs remain a significant factor in the quest for new leads in routine studies. Drug discovery methods in this area have followed developments in the market, contributing to a recent rise in the number of molecules. Nevertheless, troubling developments and fresh challenges are still evident. Recently, metformin, the most widely used first-line drug for diabetes, was found to contain a carcinogenic contaminant known as N-nitroso dimethylamine (NDMA). Therefore, purity and toxicity are also a big challenge for drug discovery and development. Moreover, newer drug classes against SGLT-2 illustrate both progress and difficulties. The same was true previously in the case of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Furthermore, researchers must study the importance of mechanistic characteristics of novel compounds, as well as exposure-related hazardous aspects of current and newly identified protein targets, in order to identify new pharmacological molecules with improved selectivity and specificity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1380, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "1.

It could be caused by a decrease in pancreatic cell insulin secretion or a lack of insulin responsiveness in the body. Insulin aids glucose assimilation within cells, allowing blood glucose levels to remain within a healthy range (80-120 mg/dL). Thus, a deficit of insulin in the body results in hyperglycemia, raising the blood glucose level, which in turn leads to many metabolic and life-threatening complications, including cardiovascular, nephropathic, and neuropathic diseases, amongst others.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2013, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A significant portion of the world's population is affected by diabetes mellitus (DM). Studies estimate that 8.8% of those between the ages of 20-79 in the world's population are diabetic. According to an International Diabetes Federation (IDF) report, the Federated States of Micronesia (Micronesia) have the world's most overweight population, with a 30% obesity prevalence. On the other hand, North American and Caribbean adults aged between 20-79 years have the highest prevalence (13%) of diabetes among Western IDF regions. In South Asian countries, diabetes prevalence is at its highest in Mauritius (22%), followed by Sri Lanka (10.7%), and India (10.4%). Approximately 425 million people worldwide are affected by diabetes, and this is projected to increase to ~629 million by the year 2045 due to unhealthy diets and inactive lifestyles.
