It is recommended to obtain the test at treatment initiation or during treatment with natalizumab, although the results will be unlikely to alter the management decision in the first 12-24 months. Anti-JCV antibody testing every 6 months and annual MRI scans are recommended during natalizumab treatment (Figure 4). Seronegative patients should continue treatment with natalizumab. In seropositive patients, the expected benefits of natalizumab treatment have to be weighed against the risks. Clinical vigilance and follow-up MRI scans are recommended as monitoring parameters (Figure 5). After 2 years of natalizumab therapy, monitoring should include more frequent MRI scans (every 3-4 months), and the benefit-risk ratio of natalizumab treatment should be reassessed and discussed with patients. The increased risk of PML with previous immunosuppressant use seems to be independent of PML risk associated with duration of natalizumab treatment. Risk stratification by previous immunosuppressant use and treatment duration must be considered in a broader context that includes additional factors such as benefits of treatment, risks of inadequately treated MS or progression of the disease, and the relative benefit-risk profiles of alternative treatments. Anti-JCV antibody status seems to be stable over time, with an annual seroconversion rate of approximately 2-3%. Specific education of physicians with respect to management of PML is needed for all prescribers.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25108, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Conclusions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25120, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "These recommendations have been developed by expert neurologists in the MENA region through a process of discussion and voting on key questions.
