After centrifugation, the organic (VP, lower phase) and aqueous (liposome, upper phase) layers were visibly separated. The VP in the lower phase was carefully transferred to a glass tube and loaded to a freshly prepared silica gel column (Sigma) equilibrated in CH2Cl2/methanol (3:1). The VP was eluted using CH2Cl2/methanol (3:1), and the green fractions containing VP were collected, pooled in a glass beaker, aliquoted in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and dried in a SpeedVac. The weight of the VP powder was determined by subtracting the weight of the Eppendorf tube after dissolving and removing VP in dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma). The VP was adjusted to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml in DMF. A standard curve of VP dye was generated by serially diluting a known concentration of VP in DMF into de-ionised and distilled H2O starting from 1000 mug/ml. The equation was y = 0.00005 x - 0.0008 (R2 = 0.9995), where y is the OD689 nm at a 1:50 dilution and x is the concentration of VP (mug/ml).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 10882, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "VP was conjugated to mfVII protein by EDC (N'-3-dimethylaminopropyl-N-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, Sigma) as a cross-linker, as previously described but with modifications.
