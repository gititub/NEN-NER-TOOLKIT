Available DMTs include interferon beta-1a (IFNbeta-1a) (Avonex , Biogen Idec, Cambridge, MA, USA; Rebif , Serono, Rockland, MA, USA), IFNbeta-1b (Betaseron , Berlex Laboratories, Montville, NJ, USA), glatiramer acetate (GA) (Copaxone , TEVA Neuroscience, Kansas City, MO, USA), and mitoxantrone (MITO) (Novantrone , Serono, Rockland, MA, USA). First-line DMT for MS is one of the IFNs or GA, which are generally well tolerated but only modestly effective; because of toxicity concerns, mitoxantrone is used more selectively in patients with very active disease characterized by frequent relapses and accumulating disability. Since approximately two thirds of patients treated with IFNs or GA relapse and eventually experience disease progression, there is a clear unmet medical need for more effective agents. Detailed analysis of therapeutic studies of current first-line DMT therapy in MS may be found in a number of reviews (; Rice at al 2006).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4373, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Natalizumab (Tysabri , Biogen Idec, Cambridge, MA, USA) is a new DMT licensed in 2006 in the EU and in the US for the treatment of RRMS.

VCAM-1 is bound by alpha4beta1-integrin (also known as very late antigen-4), an adhesion molecule found at high levels on the surface of all leukocytes except neutrophils. The interaction between VCAM-1 and alpha4beta1-integrin is required for leukocyte adhesion, firm attachment, and transmigration across the blood-brain barrier into the CNS. Natalizumab, a recombinant, humanized antibody, binds to alpha4beta1-integrin and blocks its interaction with VCAM-1. As a result, leukocyte migration into brain tissue is inhibited, reducing inflammation and preventing the formation of lesions. Natalizumab may also inhibit ongoing CNS inflammation, mediated by leukocytes already present in the CNS, by interrupting the interactions between alpha4-integrin-expressing leukocytes and extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin and osteopontin.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6405, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Natalizumab binds rapidly and with high affinity to alpha4-integrin.

MS patients treated with natalizumab 3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg IV achieved approximately 80% and 90% mean saturation of alpha4-integrin, respectively (; Biogen Idec Data on File). Weight-based dosing data from Phase 2 trials suggested that a single fixed dose of 300 mg would maintain maximal alpha4-integrin saturation for over 4 weeks. The dosage of 300 mg, administered every 4 weeks in Phase 3 trials of natalizumab, saturated alpha4-integrin to a mean level of >=70% (Biogen Idec Data on File).
