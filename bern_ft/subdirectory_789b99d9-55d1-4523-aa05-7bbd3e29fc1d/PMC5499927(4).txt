Results from this trial are summarized in Table 1. Patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) were randomized to 300 mg of intravenous natalizumab every 4 weeks (n=439) or to placebo (n=448) for up to 96 weeks. Eligible participants had an EDSS score of 3.0-6.5 and documented confirmed evidence of disease progression independent of clinical relapses within the year prior to enrollment. Most subjects had advanced disability as reflected by a mean EDSS score of 6.0-6.5 (requiring assistance to walk), and 71% of patients had been relapse free for >=2 years prior to enrollment. The primary endpoint was confirmed disability progression on one or more disability assessments: EDSS, timed 25-foot walk (T25FW), or 9-hole peg test (9HPT) (a measurement of upper-extremity disability). At 2 years, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with respect to disability progression. The proportion of patients who progressed in the placebo group was 48% as compared with 44% in the natalizumab group (P=0.287). It is worth noting that there was a significant difference found in the performance on the 9HPT between groups, with 15% worsening in the natalizumab group and 23% worsening in the placebo group (P=0.001). Nevertheless, the ASCEND trial failed to show major efficacy of natalizumab for SPMS.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 13222, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Natalizumab safety and tolerability", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 13258, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 13301, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The leading safety concern associated with natalizumab is PML, which is an uncommon and severe opportunistic brain infection caused by reactivation of a common polyomavirus, the John Cunningham virus (JCV). JCV, present in ~50%-70% of the population as evidenced by the presence of serum JCV antibodies, may remain asymptomatic in the kidneys and possibly the lymphoid organs throughout life. In selected circumstances, the JCV can become neurotropic and cause PML and demyelination of axons as a consequence of lytic infection of the myelin-producing oligodendrocytes. PML may present clinically with cognitive, motor, sensory or visual field deficits, aphasia, incoordination, and/or gait disturbance. MRI classically shows hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images with hypointensity seen on T1-weighted images. PML lesions typically do not show contrast enhancement, but some reports suggest that up to 40% of natalizumab-associated PML cases have demonstrated contrast enhancement. Lesions are often multifocal and found in the frontal and parieto-occipital regions of the brain, though there may be solitary lesions found anywhere in the brain. Diagnosis is made based on history, imaging, and CSF analysis with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for JCV. The JCV PCR assay has a high sensitivity, but a negative PCR does not completely rule out PML. At times, brain biopsy with PCR amplification of brain tissue is needed to clarify diagnosis.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 14808, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The prognosis for PML is often grim, with a high fatality rate. PML is exceedingly rare, occurring in only 0.2 per 100,000 of the general population. The risk of PML becomes significant when a patient is immune compromised as with AIDS, malignancy, or use of immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, it has been speculated that PML occurs when CNS immunosurveillance is weakened. MS alone does not confer a higher risk of PML than the general population; however, certain MS therapies have been associated with an increase in PML risk, including natalizumab. The SENTINEL study was halted 1 month early on February 28, 2005, due to reports of PML in natalizumab-treated patients.
