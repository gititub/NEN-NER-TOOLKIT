Further research will be necessary to better understand pathobiology of JCV in order to predict high-risk patients for the development of PML prior to starting MAB therapy. Modern laboratory serology and PCR-based tests might become a standard for JCV monitoring in near future but cannot currently be recommended for use unless on a clinical trial.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30691, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Authors' Note: There are no significant relationships exist between the authors and the companies/organizations whose products or services may be referenced in this article.
