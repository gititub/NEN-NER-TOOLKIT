Four additional sequence changes were identified - an A to C change (Lys to Asn substitution) at codon 117, a G to A change (Ala to Thr substitution) at codon 146, a G to A change (Arg to Gln substitution) at codon 164 and a 'silent' C to T nucleotide substitution, which did not alter the aspartic acid residue at codon 173 (Table 2). Together, these K-Ras mutations and the B-Raf V600E mutation increase overall Ras pathway mutation frequency from 27.4 to 37.8%.

To compare the transformation potential of the K-Ras mutants, therefore, NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing wt K-Ras and the K-Ras mutations G12V, G12D, G13D, Q61H, L19F, K117N, A146T and R164Q. Equivalence of plasmid loading was assessed spectrophotometrically and by western blotting for K-Ras (data not shown). Cells were stained with crystal violet and foci counted 21 days after transfection, as described in Materials and Methods (Figure 3). No foci were observed in untransfected cells or in cells transfected with wt K-Ras, whereas abundant foci were seen with each hotspot K-Ras mutation (Figure 3A). Codon 12 mutations had slightly greater transforming potential than codon 13 mutations and consistently greater transforming potential than the codon 61 Q61H mutation (Figure 3C). After transfection of additional K-Ras mutations, significant focus formation was observed for codon 117 and 146 mutations (Figure 3B). In contrast, the codon 164 mutation was phenotypically equivalent to wt K-ras with no evidence of foci formation and the codon 19 mutation generated low but consistent numbers of isolated foci (Figure 3C).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19188, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_3"}, "text": "Ras activating assays", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19210, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To assess which K-Ras mutations were in the active GTP-bound conformation, a Raf-1 binding assay was carried out as described in Materials and Methods. Raf-1 selectively binds GTP-bound Ras (rather than the inactive GDP-bound form) which, following immunoprecipitation, can be visualised by western blotting. Figure 4 illustrates the results of our analysis where, consistent with our focus formation experiments, the K-Ras G12V and L19F, K117N and A146T mutations are clearly in the active GTP-bound conformation. In contrast, the R164Q mutation, like wt K-Ras, was not GTP-bound.
