The reason for targeting receptor TF for the development of tPDT is that TF is a common but specific target on angiogenic tumour vascular endothelial cells (VEC) and many types of tumour cells, including solid tumours and leukaemia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 790, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract_title_1"}, "text": "Methods", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 798, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract"}, "text": "Murine factor VII protein (mfVII) containing a mutation (Lys341Ala) was covalently conjugated via a cross linker EDC with Veterporfin (VP) that was extracted from liposomal Visudyne, and then free VP was separated by Sephadex G50 spin columns. fVII-tPDT using mfVII-VP conjugate, compared to ntPDT, was tested in vitro for the killing of breast cancer cells and VEGF-stimulated VEC and in vivo for inhibiting the tumour growth of breast tumours in a mouse xenograft model.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1271, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract_title_1"}, "text": "Results", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1279, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract"}, "text": "We showed that: (i) fVII protein could be conjugated with VP without affecting its binding activity; (ii) fVII-tPDT could selectively kill TF-expressing breast cancer cells and VEGF-stimulated angiogenic HUVECs but had no side effects on non-TF expressing unstimulated HUVEC, CHO-K1 and 293 cells; (iii) fVII targeting enhanced the effect of VP PDT by three to four fold; (iii) fVII-tPDT induced significantly stronger levels of apoptosis and necrosis than ntPDT; and (iv) fVII-tPDT had a significantly stronger effect on inhibiting breast tumour growth in mice than ntPDT.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1853, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract_title_1"}, "text": "Conclusions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1865, "infons": {"section_type": "ABSTRACT", "type": "abstract"}, "text": "We conclude that the fVII-targeted VP PDT that we report here is a novel and effective therapeutic with improved selectivity for the treatment of breast cancer.
