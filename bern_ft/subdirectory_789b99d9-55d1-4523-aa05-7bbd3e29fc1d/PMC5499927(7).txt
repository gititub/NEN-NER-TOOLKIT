A total of 1,220 patients were examined, and 11 of the 14 PML cases diagnosed in the cohort were included in this analysis. After 2 years of natalizumab exposure, cellular L-selectin expression was noted to be significantly lower in patients who later developed PML. In this retrospective analysis, a cutoff value of 10% of L-selectin on CD4+ T cells provided the best balance between sensitivity (80%; 95% CI 41%-97%) and specificity (85%; 95% CI 76%-89%) with a hazard ratio up to 7 (95% CI 1.8-27, P=0.005). In their prospective cohort of 358 natalizumab-treated patients, cellular L-selectin levels were associated with the number of natalizumab infusions, with a decrease noted until 2 years of therapy with a subsequent increase in the value thereafter. The best time point for predicting PML was at 26 infusions in the BIONAT cohort. Similar results were not established during the analysis of samples from 21 natalizumab-treated patients with PML who were part of Biogen clinical trials. The authors who analyzed the BIONAT cohort account for this difference in findings by noting that the samples tested in the Biogen cohort occurred at an average number of 52+-5.57 infusions, at which point the levels of cellular L-selectin naturally begin to increase again. Larger prospective studies are needed in order to better elucidate the role of L-selectin in the risk stratification process of MS patients on natalizumab.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25977, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A multicenter study in Spain examined the presence of lipid-specific immunoglobulin M oligoclonal bands in the CSF, a marker found in highly inflammatory MS disease, as a predictive factor for PML. They studied 24 MS patients who developed PML and 343 who did not. They discovered that IgM bands were independently associated with decreased PML risk in patients on natalizumab (odds ratio [OR] =45.9; 95% CI 5.9-339.3; P<0.0001). Patients with CSF IgM bands and positive anti-JCV antibodies had similarly reduced PML risk to those patients who were merely anti-JCV antibody negative (OR =1.55; 95% CI 0.09-25.2; P=1.0). The highest risk of PML was found in the group of patients who were positive for anti-JCV antibodies and negative for CSF IgM bands (OR =59.71; 95% CI 13.6-262.2). The authors speculate that the presence of IgM bands is reflective of an aggressive inflammatory process that may diminish the risk of PML.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26907, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Some clinicians have attempted to lower the risk for PML by extending the dosing interval of natalizumab past the usual every 4-week administration. Standard dosing maintains maximal alpha4beta1 integrin receptor saturation, defined as >80% saturation of these receptors on the surface of lymphocytes. More than 8 weeks postadministration, serum natalizumab levels fall below 1 microg/mL, and this results in alpha4beta1 receptor desaturation, defined as saturation <50%. Extended interval dosing (EID) of natalizumab is an attempt to target a level of alpha4beta1 receptor saturation that maintains drug clinical effectiveness with the least effect possible on immunosurveillance in order to lower the PML risk. A retrospective chart review examined outcomes for 905 patients on EID versus 1,099 patients on standard interval dosing (SID). In this analysis, EID ranged from dosing every 4 weeks 3 days to dosing every 8 weeks 5 days. There were no significant differences in the two groups with respect to ARR, MRI activity, and percentage of patients who achieved no evidence of MS disease activity, though there was a significant difference with respect to JCV status (50% positive in the SID group and 63% positive in the EID group, P<0.05). While four patients developed PML in the SID cohort, zero patients developed PML in the EID cohort. However, this was a retrospective analysis, and it was not powered adequately to achieve a statistically significant PML risk reduction. More data are being collected to enhance the understanding of the risks and benefits of EID through the EXTEND registry through MSBase.
