On the other hand, the metformin finished products do not have any substitutes, which have a similar profile of action. The available substitutes for metformin are sulfonylurea derivatives (which possess a substantially higher possibility of adverse reactions) and insulin (which is a pro-injection drug that requires control of blood sugar and estimation of the dose by the patient). Therefore, a similar solution is not applicable in this case.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29020, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The GC-MS/MS method developed for the quantitation of eight NAs, including NDMA, NMEA, NDEA, NDPA, NDBA, NPip, NPyr, and NMor, was found to be suitable for the determination of traces of the analytes according to the validation results. Almost one-third of all tested samples were found to contain NDMA levels above the recommended limit based on maximum daily dosage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that describes the measured concentrations of NDMA in the metformin medicinal products. The obtained results show the actual seriousness of the situation. Therefore, manufacturers, regulatory offices, and OMCLs need to cooperate to solve this problem. In our opinion, the NDMA contamination in the metformin finished products should be considered as an unforeseen event, which was not influenced by pharmaceutical companies/manufacturers; therefore, it should not jeopardize the reputation of a pharmaceutical company at any point. However, the problem of the formation of NDMA during the manufacturing process remains unresolved; hence, routine analysis of the finished products has to be applied to guarantee the quality and safety of available medications.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30206, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Sample Availability: Samples of the compounds are not available from the authors.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30288, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Publisher's Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30414, "infons": {"section_type": "AUTH_CONT", "type": "title"}, "text": "Author Contributions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30435, "infons": {"section_type": "AUTH_CONT", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A.Z.: Methodology, Validation, Writing:Original Draft; I.K.: Writing:Review & Editing; A.S.: Supervision.
