We tested the anti-tumor effects of a specific inhibitor of Raf protein kinases, PLX4032/RG7204, in melanoma cell lines. PLX4032 decreased signaling through the MAPK pathway only in cell lines with the BRAFV600E mutation. Seven out of 10 BRAFV600E mutant cell lines displayed sensitivity based on cell viability assays and three were resistant at concentrations up to 10 muM. Among the sensitive cell lines, four were highly sensitive with IC50 values below 1 muM, and three were moderately sensitive with IC50 values between 1 and 10 muM. There was evidence of MAPK pathway inhibition and cell cycle arrest in both sensitive and resistant cell lines. Genomic analysis by sequencing, genotyping of close to 400 oncogeninc mutations by mass spectrometry, and SNP arrays demonstrated no major differences in BRAF locus amplification or in other oncogenic events between sensitive and resistant cell lines. However, metabolic tracer uptake studies demonstrated that sensitive cell lines had a more profound inhibition of FDG uptake upon exposure to PLX4032 than resistant cell lines. In conclusion, BRAFV600E mutant melanoma cell lines displayed a range of sensitivities to PLX4032 and metabolic imaging using PET probes can be used to assess sensitivity.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1474, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Background", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1485, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Improved knowledge of the oncogenic events in melanoma indicates that a majority of mutations activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The most frequent mutation in the MAPK pathway is in the BRAF gene, present in 60-70% of malignant melanomas. NRAS mutations occur in approximately 15% of melanomas and are mutually exclusive with BRAF mutations. The majority of mutations in BRAF are accounted for by a single nucleotide transversion from thymidine to adenosine leading to a substitution of valine by glutamic acid at position 600 (termed BRAFV600E), which leads to a 500-fold increase in activity compared to the wild type protein kinase.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2148, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "PLX4032 (also known as RG7204) was developed as a specific inhibitor of Raf. It is an analogue of the pre-clinically tested PLX4720. PLX4720 inhibits the mutated B-Raf kinase at 13 nM, while the wild type kinase requires tenfold higher concentration (160 nM), thus predicting high specificity for BRAFV600E mutant cell lines. The basis of this specificity for the mutated kinase is thought to be the preferential inhibition of the active conformation of B-Raf.
