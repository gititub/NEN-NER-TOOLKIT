After washing three times with MLB, the agarose beads were re-suspended in 40 mul of NuPage LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen), and 20 mul of each sample separated on SDS-PAGE.

Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13 000 r.p.m. for 15 min at 4 C and the soluble fraction transferred to a fresh 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, UK). For western blot analysis, 30 mug of each cell lysate was separated using the NuPage electrophoresis system (12% pre-cast polyacrylamide gels, Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman, Maidstone, Kent, UK). Membranes were probed with anti-K-Ras (Merck, Nottingham, UK) and anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) antibodies overnight at 4 C.

After 48 h, cells were harvested in 1 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and total RNA extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was further purified using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), eluted in a final volume of 50 mul RNAse-free dH20 and RNA quality and concentration assessed with a Bioanalyzer 2100 using the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit (Agilent). RNA labelling and microarray hybridisation was carried out in collaboration with CXR Biosciences, Dundee, UK. Briefly 1 mug of total RNA sample was amplified to generate complementary RNA (cRNA) and labelled with cyanine 3-CTP (Cys3) using the QuickAmp labelling kit, one-colour (Agilent).
