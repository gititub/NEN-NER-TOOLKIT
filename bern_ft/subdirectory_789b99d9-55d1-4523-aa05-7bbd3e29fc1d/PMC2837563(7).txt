Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed the presence of two major gene clusters, 'cluster 1' containing the G12V, G12C and G12D mutants and 'cluster 2' containing G13D, A146T, K117N, R164Q and L19F (Figure 5). It is interesting to note that the codon 12 mutants were most similar to wt K-Ras, whereas the K117N and A146T mutants clustered with the activating codon 13 and codon 61 hotspot mutants. The L19F and R164Q mutants formed a subcluster within cluster 2 suggesting, consistent with our foci formation data, that these mutants are phenotypically distinct from the G13D, A146T and K117N mutants. The presence of L19F in cluster 2 is consistent with our Ras GTPase assay data whereas, in contrast, our experimental data for R164Q predicted a 'wt' Ras phenotype. The presence of R164Q in cluster 2, rather than in cluster 1 with wt K-Ras was therefore initially surprising, but suggests that the R164Q mutation also has an 'activating' phenotype, albeit attenuated relative to the other mutations studied.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21042, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To further investigate the phenotypes associated with each of the K-Ras mutants, the expression of a diverse selection of genes associated a variety of cellular processes including signal transduction, cytoskeleton remodelling and cell adhesion was compared.

However, there were examples of genes that were induced by all of the mutants studied, including the protein tyrosine phosphatase Ptpre and the Rho GTPase activating protein Arhgap6, and multiple examples of genes induced or repressed by all of the mutants with the exception of R164Q. These included the MAPK phosphatases DUSP4 and DUSP6, Ereg, Hbegf and Btc, all involved in EGFR binding, the Rho guanine-exchange factor NGEF, cell adhesion molecule Ceacam 1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor Serpinb2.
