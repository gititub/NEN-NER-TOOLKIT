However, with the increased use of monoclonal antibodies (MAB) for various lymphoproliferative disorders, we are now seeing this infection in non-HIV patients on drugs such as natalizumab, rituximab, and so on. The aim of this article is to review the relationship between the occurrence of PML and MAB used in the treatment of hematological malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Review of articles from PubMed-indexed journals which study PML in relation to the use of MAB. Relevant literature demonstrated an increased risk of reactivation of latent John Cunningham polyomavirus (JCV) resulting in development of PML in patients on long-term therapy with MAB. The highest incidence of 1 PML case per 1000 treated patients and 1 case per 32 000 was observed in patients treated with natalizumab and rituximab, respectively. Serological and polymerase chain reaction tests for the detection of JCV can be helpful in risk stratification of patients for the development of PML before and during therapy with MAB. Treatment with MAB can result in development of PML. Clinicians should include PML in differential diagnosis in patients treated with these agents if they manifest central nervous system symptoms.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1398, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1411, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) was first described in 1958 by Astrom et al. In 1965, ZuRhein and Chou suggested that a papovavirus was the cause of PML. In the largest review of PML to that date published in 1984, Brooks and Walker identified 230 cases that were published in the English-written literature or from their own experience. Of these, 69 patients were pathologically confirmed and only 40 tested positive with viral tests and pathology. Ninety-five percent of patients had an underlying condition that predisposed them to PML, of which nearly two-thirds had an underlying B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) while an underlying primary immunodeficiency was evident in 16% of cases. With the concern of association of PML and B-cell LPD, the risk of developing PML in patients on therapies that alter the B-cell function became an important issue. As the use of monoclonal antibodies (MAB) such as natalizumab, rituximab, and efalizumab increased, there was also a rise in the literature of PML cases in patients treated with these antibodies. Due to a life-threatening clinical course of PML, it is important for clinicians to gain a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the John Cunningham polyomavirus (JCV), risk of JCV reactivation, and how different anti-CD20-directed MAB may play a role in this reactivation. This review aims to educate clinicians on these issues.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2826, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A search of PubMed-indexed journals was used to find articles related to JCV, PML, and MAB.
