It has also been used in other diseases mediated by the immune system, such as acute rejection of solid organ transplants, rheumatoid arthritis, and graft-versus-host disease. Because of its ability to deplete T-cell populations, alemtuzumab has also been used as a conditioning agent in solid organ transplantation and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Martin et al conducted a follow-up study on 27 patients on alemtuzumab and described 1 case which developed PML. Another study reported PML development in a few patients who were on alemtuzumab. The mechanism responsible for PML is due to depletion of cytotoxic T cells that kill or suppress the latent JCV-infected cells. Rates of PML in patients with alemtuzumab remain low, but clinicians should think about this disease in patients on the medication with PML-like symptoms.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 17875, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Efalizumab", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 17886, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Efalizumab is another immunomodulatory agent that acts by binding to CD11a, the alpha subunit of leukocyte function antigen-1, which is expressed on all leukocytes and decreases cell surface expression of CD11a.

This medication has also been tested in CLL with limited studies at this time. The FDA-approved uses of efalizumab include severe plaque psoriasis and antirejection therapy in certain transplants. The drug was tested in patients with CLL but did not receive an FDA approval for this use.

It is also FDA approved to be as a consolidation therapy after autologous HSCT in patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma. It has been used in non-FDA-approved trials in other CD30+ lymphomas and is being studied in the upfront setting in classical Hodgkin lymphoma. CD30 is a membrane glycoprotein and a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family, and signaling through CD30 can have pleiotropic effects, depending on the type and activation state of the cell. The cytoplasmic CD30 domain interacts with multiple members of the TNF receptor-associated factor family and is capable of inducing apoptosis through the c-Jun N-terminal kinase np38. It also mediates cell activation via nuclear factor kappa B as well as effector functions via Fas-associated protein with death domain.

Whether CD30 activation results in proliferation of cells or reduced viability depends on the cell type receiving the signal and the environment in which the signal is delivered. Brentuximab is a very important drug that has shown high remission rates in Hodgkin lymphoma especially in people older than 60 years and has shown remission rates of greater than >50%. Treatment with BV is currently a standard of care for patients with relapsed or refractory systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and for patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma after autologous stem cell transplantation or at least 2 prior combination chemotherapy regimens.
