It is recommended as a single disease-modifying therapy (DMT) in patients with highly active relapsing-remitting MS to prevent relapses and delay progression of disability. Natalizumab is indicated in patients who fail to respond to a full and adequate course (normally at least 1 year of treatment) of interferon-beta or glatiramer acetate, or for those who have rapidly evolving, severe relapsing-remitting MS. Failure to respond is defined as at least one relapse in the previous year on therapy and at least nine T2-lesions in cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or at least one gadolinium-enhancing (Gd) lesion. Rapidly evolving severe relapsing-remitting MS can be defined by at least two disabling relapses in 1 year and at least one Gd-enhancing lesion on brain MRI or a significant increase of T2 burden.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4164, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Natalizumab improves clinical and MRI outcomes and reduces the rate of relapse and disability progression in relapsing-remitting MS.

PML is an opportunistic infection of the central nervous system that is caused by John Cunningham virus (JCV). The virus replicates in glial cells of the brain, leading to lytic death of oligodendrocytes. PML is very rare in immunocompetent people, typically occurring in severely immunocompromised patients such as those with HIV infection, malignant disease or organ transplants. It may present with any combination of weakness, speech disturbances, limb incoordination, cognitive deficits and visual impairment, usually resulting in death or severe disability. Three cases of PML were identified in the pivotal natalizumab clinical trials.
