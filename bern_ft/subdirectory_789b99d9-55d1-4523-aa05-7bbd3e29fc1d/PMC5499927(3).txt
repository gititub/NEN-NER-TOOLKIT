Fifty-seven percent of patients treated with natalizumab developed no new or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions over the 2-year study period compared with 15% of placebo patients. Natalizumab also decreased the mean number of lesions detected by gadolinium-enhanced MRI by 92% at both 1 and 2 years. Ninety-seven percent of natalizumab patients had no gadolinium-enhancing lesions on the year 2 MRI scan versus 72% of placebo patients (P<0.001). In addition, the mean number of new T1-hypointense lesions over 2 years was 1.1 in the natalizumab group and 4.6 in the placebo group, a 76% reduction (P<0.001). The mean percentage of reduction in brain parenchymal fraction (BPF), a marker of brain atrophy, was similar between groups (P=0.822).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 7944, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The Safety and Efficacy of Natalizumab in Combination with Interferon Beta-1a in Patients with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (SENTINEL) study was also a 2-year Phase III trial that was similarly designed to AFFIRM. A total of 1,171 RRMS patients across 123 clinical centers in Europe and the United States were randomized to receive either a combination of natalizumab 300 mg intravenously every 4 weeks plus interferon (IFN) beta-1a 30 microg via intramuscular injection weekly or placebo infusion every 4 weeks plus IFN beta-1a 30 microg via intramuscular injection weekly. Eligible subjects had at least one clinical relapse in the 12-month period leading up to study start while on IFN beta-1a therapy alone. As in the AFFIRM trial, the primary endpoint was the rate of clinical relapse at 1 year. Secondary outcomes at 1 year included the number of new or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions, the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions, and the proportion of patients free of relapse. Again, the primary outcome at 2 years was the cumulative probability of sustained disability progression, defined as an increase by at least 1.0 point in the EDSS score from a baseline score of at least 1.0 or an increase by at least 1.5 points in the EDSS score from a baseline score of 0, sustained for 12 weeks. After 1 year, the ARR for natalizumab combination therapy was 0.38 compared with 0.82 for IFN beta-1a alone, a 54% reduction in the relapse rate (P<0.001). This effect was durable at 2 years, with ARR of 0.34 in the combination therapy group compared with ARR of 0.75 in the placebo group at year 2 (P<0.001). Patients on the combination of natalizumab and IFN beta-1a were less likely to have sustained disability progression at 12 weeks than those on IFN beta-1a alone (23% vs 29%, respectively, P=0.02), representing a 24% decrease in the risk of sustained disability progression on combination therapy. Estimates of sustained disability progression at 24 weeks were not statistically significant between the two treatment groups (P=0.17). With respect to imaging, there was an 83% reduction in the number of new or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions over a 2-year period in the natalizumab combination therapy group compared with the IFN beta-1a alone group. SENTINEL also demonstrated an 89% reduction in gadolinium-enhancing lesions in the natalizumab group.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 10320, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "An Italian single-center retrospective study examined 152 RRMS patients who began natalizumab therapy between February 2007 and October 2008 and examined their long-term outcomes to determine how many patients maintained their status of no evidence of disease activity (NEDA). NEDA was defined as absence of relapses, absence of sustained disability worsening (described as >=1.0 point increase on EDSS confirmed at 6 months), and absence of radiographic activity (gadolinium-enhancing lesions or new/enlarged T2-hyperintense lesions). In this cohort, 58 of the original 152 patients were still on natalizumab treatment after 7 years and 94 had discontinued treatment after a median time of 3 years. When analyzed with an intention-to-treat model, 52 (34%) patients maintained NEDA by the end of the 7-year follow-up. This number increased to 41% of patients maintaining NEDA status when excluding the 64 patients who discontinued natalizumab due to concerns about potential progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). The authors compared this rate to previous studies showing rates of long-term clinical stability in <10% of patients on injectable therapies.
