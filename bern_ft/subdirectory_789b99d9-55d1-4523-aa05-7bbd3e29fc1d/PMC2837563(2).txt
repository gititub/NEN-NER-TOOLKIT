However, fewer than 10% of colorectal adenomas develop into invasive cancers and a number of molecular mechanisms including epigenetic events, DNA mismatch-repair defects, chromosomal rearrangements and mutations in key oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes have been suggested to regulate progression from adenoma to adenocarcinoma.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2366, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A genetic model for colorectal cancer highlighted key genes, including the tumour suppressor genes adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and p53 and the oncogene Kirsten-Ras (K-Ras), the progressive acquisition of mutations in which was proposed to regulate the adenoma-carcinoma transition. We subsequently refined this model, highlighting a significant increase in K-Ras mutation frequency in Dukes' C tumours, suggesting that K-Ras mutation status may be an important determinant of tumour progression. We additionally used comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) analysis to identify common chromosomal aberrations in colorectal tumours, and highlighted an amplification of the region of chromosome 12p where the K-Ras gene is localised. We and others have shown that K-Ras mutations are associated with significantly reduced survival in colorectal cancer patients, although previous data is not entirely consistent. K-Ras mutation status has recently been convincingly associated with response to the new generation EGFR antagonists cetuximab (Erbitux) and panitumumab (Vectibix), where response is preferentially observed in wt K-Ras tumours. K-Ras mutation testing is therefore increasingly recommended to facilitate selection of the most appropriate patients for treatment with EGFR antagonists.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3665, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "K-Ras is a member of the highly homologous family of small p21Ras G proteins (H-Ras, N-Ras and K-Ras) which transduce signals across the plasma membrane, principally by activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK-MAPK signalling cascade (Figure 1). Ras genes are the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancer, where tumour-specific mutations lead to the permanent activation of Ras signalling cascades, influencing proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Previous analyses of K-Ras mutations in human tumours have consistently focussed on single-point mutations in codons 12, 13 and 61, where mutation has been shown to result in reduced Ras GAP GTPase activity, locking the protein in the active Ras-GTP conformation, although additional mutations at codons 19, 22 and 146 have been described in single colorectal tumour case reports.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4513, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Ras proteins regulate signal transduction by activating a number of downstream effector proteins, including the cytoplasmic serine/threonine protein kinase B-Raf (Figure 1). B-Raf mutations have also been identified in human cancers, including melanoma and thyroid, ovarian and colorectal tumours, although mutation frequency estimates in colorectal tumours vary from 1 to 20%, and have been particularly associated with tumours deficient in mismatch-repair activity. The most common B-Raf mutation is a T to A transversion, resulting in a valine to glutamic acid substitution (V600E), present in approximately 90% of B-Raf mutant tumours, which results in a 500-fold increase in in vitro kinase activity and the induction of cell proliferation and transformation. Although K-Ras and B-Raf mutations are found in the same tumour types, they are thought to be mutually exclusive, providing distinct but related mechanisms for the activation of K-Ras signalling pathways.
