This difference was attributed to an unusual decrease in relapses in the placebo group, rather than to an increase in the natalizumab group. No other studies have found an increase in disease activity beyond the untreated state after stopping natalizumab treatment. concluded that natalizumab was superior to placebo in reducing the formation of brain lesions, but that the duration of the study was too short to detect possible differences in clinical outcomes.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 14802, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial assessed the effects of IV natalizumab 3 mg/kg (n = 68), natalizumab 6 mg/kg (n = 74), or placebo (n = 71) administered every 4 weeks for 6 months to patients with RRMS or SPMS. All patients were followed for an additional 6 months. This study had a longer treatment period and enrolled more patients than the study by. As with the previous study, the primary endpoints were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of brain lesions. Secondary and tertiary endpoints were clinical measures such as relapses, disability progression, and patient well-being. During the 6-month treatment period, MRI data showed that natalizumab dramatically reduced the mean number of new Gd+ lesions compared with placebo (9.6 lesions per patient in the placebo group, 0.7 in thenatalizumab 3 mg/kg group, and 1.1 in the natalizumab 6 mg/kg group; p < 0.001 for either natalizumab dose vs placebo). There was no statistically significant difference between the two natalizumab dose groups. Natalizumab also markedly reduced the mean number of persistent Gd+ lesions, the mean total volume of Gd+ lesions, and the mean number of new active lesions (p <= 0.01 vs placebo for all comparisons). Clinical results showed that natalizumab reduced the number of patients who experienced a relapse by approximately half compared with placebo during the 6-month treatment period (19% for either active treatment group vs 38% in the placebo group; p = 0.02 for both comparisons). No statistically significant changes in disability, as measured by expanded disability status scale (EDSS), were observed in any group. A patient-assessed visual analogue scale showed improvements in the natalizumab treatment groups and a small worsening in the placebo group (p <= 0.04, natalizumab vs placebo). The use of corticosteroids to ameliorate relapses was also significantly reduced in the natalizumab groups compared with placebo (p <= 0.001), suggesting that relapse symptoms for patients treated with natalizumab were less intense than for patients receiving placebo. The main conclusions of this study were that natalizumab dramatically reduced lesion formation and relapses, and that longer-term studies were needed to assess the effect of natalizumab on progression of disability.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 17138, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "A subgroup analysis of the same study examined whether natalizumab could reduce the conversion of Gd+ lesions, which are associated with ongoing inflammation and demyelination, to more permanent T1-hypointense lesions. Patients were included in the subgroup analysis if they had one or more new Gd+ lesions during months 0 to 6 of treatment and had at least 6 months of follow-up data. To improve statistical power, data from both natalizumab dose groups were pooled (n = 40) for analysis against placebo (n = 38) group data. At month 12, Gd+ lesions converted to T1-hypointense lesions in 26% of patients in the natalizumab group compared with 68% of those in the placebo group (p < 0.01).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 17829, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The clinical efficacy of natalizumab in treating acute MS relapses was investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial of 180 patients with RRMS or SPMS.

Patients did not receive corticosteroids, which typically would be prescribed in cases of relapse. No statistically significant differences in clinical endpoints were observed with natalizumab versus placebo. While post-hoc analysis revealed less of an increase in the mean volume of Gd+ lesions in the natalizumab groups compared with the placebo group at week 1 (p = 0.021 for combined natalizumab groups vs placebo) and at week 3 (p = 0.024 for combined natalizumab groups vs placebo), no differences were seen at week 14.
