They work by activating glucose transporters on muscle and fat cells, thus mimicking the function of insulin. Insulin sensitizers work by increasing the sensitivity of body tissues towards insulin. A variety of observable cardiac risk factors such as an increased risk of blood clotting, elevated blood pressure, lipid profile or C-reactive protein, undesired lipoprotein(a) or serum fibrinogen, and even abnormal thickening of the heart muscle have also been shown to improve upon use of insulin sensitizers.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 11023, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "3.3.
