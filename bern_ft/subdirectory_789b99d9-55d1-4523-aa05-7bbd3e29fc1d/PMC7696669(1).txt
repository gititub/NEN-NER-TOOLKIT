Good linearity for each compound was demonstrated over the calibration range of 0.5-9.5 ng/mL. The assay for all substances was accurate and precise. NDMA was not detected in the acquired active pharmaceutical ingredient (API); however, NDMA was detected in 64 (85.3%) and 22 (91.7%) of the finished product and prolonged finished product samples, respectively. European Medicines Agency recommends the maximum allowed limit of 0.032 ppm in the metformin products. Hence, 28 finished products and 7 pronged dosage products were found to exceed the acceptable limit of daily intake of NDMA contamination. The implications of our findings for the testing of pharmaceutical products are discussed.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 986, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "1. Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1002, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In general, N-nitrosamines (NAs) are the products of reactions between a nitrosating agent and a secondary or tertiary amine; NAs are formed preferentially at elevated temperature. Thus, NAs are mainly detected in food and drinks after processing. In foods, nitrous anhydride is the main nitrosating agent formed from nitrite in an acidic aqueous solution. In drinking water, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is the most simple and volatile NA that can form during the degradation of dimethylhydrazine (a component of rocket fuel) by chloramination of amine-based precursors or as a byproduct of anion exchange purification of water. NDMA has been shown to be formed in certain foods due to a direct-fire drying process. International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified NDMA as a probable carcinogen in humans. NDMA is known to be genotoxic in vivo and in vitro. Several case-control studies and a single cohort study of NDMA in humans supported the assumption that NDMA consumption is positively associated with either gastric or colorectal cancer. Therefore, due to possible contamination of water with NDMA, the World Health Organization (WHO) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have set the drinking water guideline limits to 100 ng/L and 0.4 ng/L in tap water, respectively. Only in a few foods and countries, limits have been set for NAs. In the United States, a limit of 10 microg/kg has been set for total volatile NAs in cured meat products. In 2005, China introduced a limit of 4 and 7 microg/kg of NDMA in fish and related products, respectively. There are currently no maximum regulatory limits for the level of N-nitroso-compounds in food in the European Union.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2703, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Recently, NDMA and other NAs, e.g., N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), have been detected in several pharmaceuticals, including sartans (valsartan, losartan, and candesartan) and raniditine. The detection of the NDMA impurity was incidental and happened while performing other tests. Improvement in the analytical techniques enabled the detection of NAs concentrations as low as 1 ng/L. After a thorough investigation, it was discovered that changes in the production process of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) are one of the actual reasons for NDMA contamination of valsartan.
