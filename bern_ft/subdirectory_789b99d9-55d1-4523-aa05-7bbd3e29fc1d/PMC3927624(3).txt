The panel used the revised 2010 Mcdonald diagnostic criteria for MS in the discussion and recommendations. The neurologists reviewed evidence on the efficacy of natalizumab in comparison with other MS therapies, and on the risk of PML and its early detection and management. Relevant cases were discussed to highlight clinical decision points, and agreement was reached on key topics through voting on a series of questions on the positioning of natalizumab in the MS treatment paradigm. Several important factors were discussed, including appropriate patient selection, routine safety monitoring, and an understanding of both early recognition and timely management of PML. Disease breakthrough was defined as either clinical (relapse or disability progression) or radiological activity (new T2 lesion or Gd-enhancing lesions on MRI) or a combination of both. Relapse was defined as new or recurrent neurologic symptoms not associated with fever or infection that lasted for at least 24 hours and were accompanied by new neurological signs found by the examining neurologist. Disease progression was defined as an increase of at least 1.5 points on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. Disabling relapse was defined as a relapse with a residual disability, which was defined as incomplete recovery at 1 month from a relapse.
