Due to NDMA contamination, 22 countries issued recalls involving 2,300 valsartan batches from Germany, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Hungary, the Netherlands, Austria, Ireland, Bulgaria, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, France, Poland, Croatia, Lithuania, Greece, Canada, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bahrain and Malta. However, in addition to sartans and ranitidine, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recently announced that metformin-containing finished products can be contaminated with NDMA.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3779, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Metformin is the most widely used medication around the world for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Usually, metformin is the first-line treatment that works by reducing the production of glucose in the body and reducing glucose absorption from the gut. Metformin is also effective against various conditions, including prediabetes, polycystic ovarian syndrome, obesity, gestational diabetes mellitus, and cancer. Metformin has a relatively high allowed dosage up to 2-3 g/day in Europe and the USA. Therefore, the limit for NDMA and other NAs has been set according to the maximum daily dosage (3 g/day). Acceptable intake of NDMA according to EMA is 92 ng/day (the acceptable intake is a daily exposure to a compound, such as NDMA, NDEA, or N-nitrosomethylbutylamine (NMBA), that approximates a 1:100,000 cancer risk after 70 years of exposure). Therefore, recommended the maximum allowed limit of NDMA in the metformin products to be set at 0.032 ppm.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4745, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The main aim of the present study was to assay the NDMA content in the metformin API and finished products. The gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) method for quantification of NDMA and seven additional NAs was developed and validated. Additional attempts that can explain the mechanism of NDMA formation during the manufacturing process were conducted. The developed method was successfully applied to the analysis of 105 different metformin products of 13 different companies providing detailed insight into various degrees of NDMA contamination in metformin finished products on the European market.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5367, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "2.

An additional peak at approximately 8 min was observed in the sample solution depending on the finished product manufacturer. The peak had a single MRM transition of the NDMA (77   44.10) and did not co-elute with NDMA. Additional studies revealed that the peak can be N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), which can be used in the synthesis of metformin.
