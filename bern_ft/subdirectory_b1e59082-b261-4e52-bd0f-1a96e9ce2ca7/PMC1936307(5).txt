To assess the efficacy of natalizumab in the short-term control of brain lesion formation, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial was conducted in patients with RRMS or SPMS. Patients received two IV infusions of natalizumab 3 mg/kg (n = 37) or placebo (n = 35), administered at weeks 0 and 4, and were followed through week 24. Between weeks 1 and 12, natalizumab reduced the mean number of new active lesions per patient by half compared with placebo (1.8 vs 3.6, respectively; p = 0.042). Patients treated with natalizumab also developed fewer new gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions, which are associated with breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, than patients receiving placebo (1.6 vs 3.3 mean lesions per patient, respectively; p = 0.017) during weeks 1 to 12. During weeks 12 to 24, there were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the mean cumulative number of new Gd+ lesions or in the proportion of scans without new Gd+ lesions. It also was noted that, during weeks 12 to 24, patients who had been treated with natalizumab had a higher relapse rate than those who had received placebo.
