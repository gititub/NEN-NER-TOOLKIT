Figures 7A and B illustrate chromosome metaphase spreads confirming FISH probe specificities for chromosomes 12p and 12q, respectively, whereas Figures 7C and D show representative colorectal tumour FISH analysis. Figure 7C illustrates a tumour sample (study code 1271) in which the K-Ras gene is not amplified (red fluorescence=green fluorescence), whereas Figure 7D illustrates a colorectal tumour (study code 1264) with K-Ras gene amplification (red fluorescence>green fluorescence). Signals from the red 12p12.1 probe in tumour 1264 appear as a cluster of bright dots forming a line which is suggestive of a homogeneously staining region (HSR), a chromosomal region which is amplified either on the original chromosome or on another chromosome, as opposed to double minutes where the amplified gene is located in extra-chromosomal circular DNA molecules.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24639, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Discussion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24650, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Recent clinical data has shown a compelling association between K-Ras and B-Raf mutation status and response to EGFR blockade by cetuximab and panitumumab in the treatment of metastatic colorectal tumours. K-Ras mutations in colorectal tumours have been extensively documented, where recent meta analysis of more than 3000 tumours estimates an average K-Ras mutation frequency of 34.8%. This and the majority of previous analyses were, however, limited to codons 12 and 13, whereas only a minority of studies have additionally analysed codon 61. Although additional K-Ras mutations have been reported outwith these 'hotspot' codons, to our knowledge, there has been no systematic analysis of K-Ras mutation frequency in human colorectal tumours. Our use of 'WAVE' denaturing HPLC (dHPLC) analysis allowed us to carry out a rapid, systematic analysis of the entire K-Ras coding sequence to identify colorectal tumours with sequence changes, the nature which were subsequently confirmed by conventional dideoxy sequencing.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25679, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Our data clearly demonstrates that K-Ras mutations in human colorectal tumours are likely to be significantly underestimated if only hotspot codons are analysed. Indeed, current mutation screening tests based on the hotspot codons 12 and 13 are likely to result in the mis-classification of up to one-third of patients. Although mutations at codons 19, 117 and 164 are relatively rare events, our data suggests that each K-Ras mutation may differentially influence treatment response. We would therefore recommend the adoption of comprehensive K-Ras mutation profiling, or at least the routine inclusion of the codon 146 mutation, for patient selection for cetuximab and related therapies.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26369, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Current data from the COSMIC database, which summarises literature data and the ongoing Sanger cancer-genome project describes 29 K-Ras colorectal tumour mutations outwith codons 12, 13 and 61, and more than 11 800 mutations at these hotspot codons (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/), but does not describe associated phenotypes. Consistent with our own data, codon 146 was the most frequently mutated of the mutations described. K-Ras codon 146 mutations have been described in a human colorectal tumour cell line, in mice with thymic lymphomas and in a single human colorectal tumour case report.
