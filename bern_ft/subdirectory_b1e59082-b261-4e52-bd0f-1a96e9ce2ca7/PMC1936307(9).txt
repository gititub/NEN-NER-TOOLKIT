To participate in SENTINEL, patients had to be 18 to 55 years of age, have MRI lesions consistent with MS, have an EDSS score of 0.0 to 5.0, and have at least one relapse within the previous 12 months, but not within 50 days before randomization. The primary endpoints were identical to those of AFFIRM. Natalizumab/IFNbeta-1a reduced the mean annualized relapse rate by 54% at 1 year and 55% at 2 years compared with IFNbeta-1a alone (both p < 0.001). Over 2 years, the risk of sustained disability progression, as defined in AFFIRM, was reduced by 24% in patients receiving combination therapy compared with monotherapy (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.61-0.96; p = 0.02) (Table 3). In addition, natalizumab/IFNbeta-1a decreased the mean number of new or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions by 83% over 2 years and the mean number of Gd+ lesions by 89% at 2 years, compared with IFNbeta-1a alone (both p < 0.001).

In AFFIRM, AE rates were not significantly different between the natalizumab and placebo groups, except for fatigue (27% vs 21%, respectively) and allergic reactions (9% vs 4%) (both p < 0.05).
