Figure 2 (1) presents the NDMA recoveries of the spiked samples. The calculated recovery was found to be outside of the +-2 x SD range of obtained mean recovery only three times of all tests performed however, the set limit for the recovery was 70-130%, meaning that each analysis remains valid. Additionally, the yield of the extraction of NDMA from water solution to CH2Cl2 was controlled by the IS - d6-NDMA recovery.

Figure 2 (3) shows the changes in one of the most important parameters, which influences the measurement in the majority of the samples, the slope of the calibration curves. The slope value appears to have a slight trend towards a higher value, which may be due to the evaporation of the stock standard solution (dissolved in MeOH) despite being stored in a freezer.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 8136, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The main aim of the proposed GC-MS/MS method is the determination of NDMA in the metformin API or finished products.

The chromatography method was developed to evaluate each prepared sample and estimate whether it is contaminated by mistake at any point in the preparation. If the samples contain any additional NAs apart from NDMA, an investigation should be performed to determine if there was a mistake in the sample preparation or if metformin is indeed contaminated with another NA.

It is worth mentioning that during the development of the method, we have experienced issues due to artifact formation in the sample solution. In the beginning, the sample preparation method was based on the direct extraction of the metformin API in the CH2Cl2 solution containing the IS. Various syringe filters were tested to remove undissolved metformin from the CH2Cl2 solution. Based on the acquired results, we concluded that an artifact was experienced when the nylon syringe filters were used. The amount of NDMA formation after the filtration differed based on the time of the filtration and the brand of the filter used. However, during the method development, there was no information about the NDMA origin/formation in metformin, and thus, NDMA could have been entrapped in the metformin crystals; based on the obtained results, development of the method for direct CH2Cl2 extraction was discontinued, and the extraction of the aqueous solution of metformin was pursued.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 10062, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "2.3.
