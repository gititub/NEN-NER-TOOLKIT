The combination of liquid-liquid extraction with CH2Cl2, which is the most popular extraction solvent for NAs, with splitless injection in GC appears to be the most frequently used in the case of analysis of sartans by Official Medicines Control Laboratories (OMCLs). A similar solution was also already used in the method originated from Singapore; however, sample preparation requires using 0.1 M solution of hydrochloric acid as a water phase. In order to minimize the risk of the unwanted reaction between hydrochloric acid or its impurities, it was decided to use deionized water instead. Nevertheless, using CH2Cl2 is apparently the easiest, the fastest, and robust sample preparation; all the properties are required in the quality control of the medicinal products.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 15424, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In addition to the studies of NDMA contamination in the metformin finished products, experiments were conducted to further investigate the NA formation mechanism. The most obvious way to prove that NDMA originates during the manufacturing process is to measure NDMA in API and in finished products in which this particular API was used. Figure 3 represents the results (Manufacturer 1), obtained with four different batches of API and 24 different batches of finished products manufactured with analyzed API. The content of NDMA in API was always below the LOD; however, in the finished product, NDMA presence was detected in 22 batches, and 15 batches had NDMA level in excess of the 0.032 ppm recommended limit. Therefore, the manufacturing process of various batches of the excipients has an impact on the NDMA content. We received a list of all excipients used in the manufacturing process from Manufacturer 1 to evaluate possible NDMA contamination. However, no NDMA was found in all provided substances, and we, thus, conclude that the excipients are not the source of NDMA.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 16505, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Another result confirming that NDMA is manufacturing contamination that was obtained in the batches from Manufacturers 2 and 3. The problem apparently occurs in the manufacturing process of prolonged dosage products. The manufacturing process and the excipients were different from those in the finished product. A similar situation occurs in the case of Manufacturer 3; seven batches had NDMA concentration above 0.140 ppm, and five batches had NDMA concentrations below 0.032 ppm (two batches with prolonged dosage). After these results were obtained, we have identified that these five and seven batches were manufactured in different places. Therefore, the manufacturing line and excipients were probably different, and as a result, the NDMA content was also different.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 17279, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "One of the hypotheses on the mechanism of the NDMA formation during the manufacturing process is that dimethylamine (DMA, impurity F, according to European Pharmacopeia, 0,05% w/w allowed) present in the metformin API is reacting with the residual nitrites/nitrates from the excipients during the wet granulation process. However, heating of the API containing 0.03% DMA mixed with sodium nitrite and sodium nitrate did not generate NDMA-positive results (data not shown). Despite that heating metformin API with nitrites/nitrates, it is not an actual manufacturing process, some other factor probably is needed to catalyze the NDMA formation, and this factor is delivered through one of the excipients; at this point, the factor eludes detection.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18027, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Another possible hypothesis is that NDMA is formed during the blistering process of the finished product (the tablets in blisters are exposed to transient high temperature during film sealing) or is present as an impurity of the ink, which is used to print on the aluminum foil. However, our study indicates that NDMA is not a surface impurity, but is rather an impurity that is present in the whole tablet mass. Heating the tablets at a high temperature (100  C) with NDMA levels above or below the set limit (0.032 ppm) does not increase NDMA concentration, and instead decreases it:probably as a result of NDMA evaporation. However, the is a possibility that during the high-temperature treatment, the substrates needed to form NDMA have already reacted, and heating the tablets for the second time does not cause additional NDMA formation.
