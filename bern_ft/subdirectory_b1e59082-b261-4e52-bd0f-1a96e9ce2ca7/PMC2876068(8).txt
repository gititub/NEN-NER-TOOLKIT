Exposure to PLX4032 resulted in a marked decrease in pErk in both cell lines, but this was more prominent and durable in the sensitive M229 compared to the resistant M233. M229 has a heterozygous PTEN deletion by SNP array analysis, and had a detectable band for PTEN protein by Western blot that did not change with PLX4032 exposure. The resistant M233 cell line has a homozygous PTEN deletion and has no PTEN protein by Western blot. This correlates with baseline pAkt detectable in M233 but not M229, as well as increase in pAkt upon PLX4032-exposure in the resistant M233 but not in the sensitive M229 cell line. Interestingly, pS6 decreased in both cell lines upon PLX4032 exposure. Finally, we explored if there was modulation of AMPK, which has been recently described as a downstream modulator of glucose metabolism in BRAFV600E mutants. There was a low level of induction of pAMPK. These studies demonstrate that PLX4032 has complex effects on MAPK and PI3k/Akt signaling pathways that may be dependent on secondary oncogenic events beyond B-Raf.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20619, "infons": {"file": "1479-5876-8-39-3.jpg", "id": "F3", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Western blot analysis of phosphorylated and total amount of key proteins in the MAPK and PI3k/Akt pathways. a) The PLX4032-sensitive M229 cell line and the PLX4032-resistant M233 cell line were cultured in different concentrations of PLX4032 for 24 hours and lysates were analyzed by Western blot. b) M229 and M233 cells were treated by PLX4032 in a time course over 24 hours, and cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21044, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Non-invasive imaging of PLX4032 anti-tumor activity", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 21096, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We analyzed the uptake profile of three different metabolic tracers that can be used in PET scans: two nucleoside analogs (thymidine and FAC) and FDG, a glucose analog widely used as a PET tracer. As expected, BRAF wild type cell lines had no significant change in uptake of thymidine or FAC upon PLX4032-exposure. Conversely, all BRAFV600E mutated cell lines, irrespective of their sensitivity to PLX4032, had markedly decreased uptake of these two nucleoside analogues (Figure 4a and 4b). The greatest difference between PLX4032-sensitive and -resistant BRAFV600E mutants was in FDG uptake. The percentage decrease in FDG uptake was roughly double in PLX4032-sensitive BRAFV600E mutants compared to PLX4032-resistant cell lines (P = 0.009, Figure 4c). Finally, we tested if [18F]-FDG uptake could be used as a pharmacodynamic marker of B-RafV600E inhibition by PLX4032 in vivo. Mice with established subcutaneous M249 melanoma xenografts, a cell line highly sensitive to PLX4032 in vitro, were treated for 3 days with PLX4032 twice daily by oral gavage, and then analyzed by combined microPET and microCT using [18F]-FDG as PET tracer. There was a 32% decrease in [18F]-FDG uptake compared to the vehicle control mice, even though tumor sizes were not different at this early time point (Figure 4d). In conclusion, inhibition of [18F]-FDG uptake can be used as an early marker of effective B-RafV600E inhibition by PLX4032.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22522, "infons": {"file": "1479-5876-8-39-4.jpg", "id": "F4", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Metabolic tracer uptake profile upon exposure to PLX4032. a-c) in vitro PET tracer uptake profiles for 11 different melanoma cell lines.
