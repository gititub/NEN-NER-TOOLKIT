In addition, its access to a Raf-selective pocket accounts for the selectivity against most other non-Raf kinases, which require concentrations 100 to 1000 times higher for kinase inhibition. The only exception is the breast tumor kinase (BRK), which is inhibited at 130 nM, a one-log difference compared to the V600E mutated B-Raf kinase.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2949, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In the current studies we analyzed a panel of human melanoma cell lines with defined oncogenic alterations for sensitivity to PLX4032. In addition, with a view to development of a biomarker to indicate response to targeted therapy, we investigated a non-invasive method of imaging resistance versus sensitivity in vivo. We describe that PLX4032 works differentially in melanoma cell lines with BRAFV600E mutations and that the positron emission tomography (PET) tracer 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) can be used in non-invasive PET imaging to distinguish between sensitive and resistant cell lines.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3550, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Materials and methods", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3572, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Reagents and cell lines", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3596, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "PLX4032 (also known as RG7204 or RO5185426) was obtained under a materials transfer agreement (MTA) with Plexxikon (Berkeley, CA) and dissolved in DMSO (Fisher Scientific, Morristown, NJ) to a stock concentration of 10 mM.
