The large, controlled, Phase 3 trials (the AFFIRM and SENTINEL studies), which led to approval of natalizumab in the EU and US, are among the most rigorous and well-designed trials of DMTs to date, and are the most relevant indicators of likely performance in the general population of patients with relapsing MS. After 2 years in the AFFIRM study, patients treated with natalizumab monotherapy had an annualized relapse rate 68% lower than that of patients receiving placebo; this is approximately double the reduction typically observed with IFNs or GA. In the same study, sustained disability progression was decreased by 42%, and the mean number of new brain lesions was reduced by 83 to 92%. In the SENTINEL study of patients with continued disease activity despite receiving IFNbeta-1a therapy, the addition of natalizumab to the standard regimen of IFNbeta-1a decreased the annualized relapse rate by 55%, sustained disability progression by 24%, and the mean number of new lesions by 83 to 89%, compared with IFNbeta-1a alone. Uniquely, among the trials of DMTs, significant efficacy was seen in nearly all primary, secondary, and tertiary endpoints, including the quality of life measurements. Although direct head-to-head comparisons have not been performed, the preponderance of data strongly supports the notion that natalizumab offers greater efficacy than existing DMTs. Clearly, since MS is a life-long illness, it is important to recognize that the benefits found on relatively short-term measures seen in clinical trials may not translate into long-term effects in the prevention of disability progression. Natalizumab is not a cure for RRMS but it is a significant improvement on current therapy and given its efficacy and tolerability, natalizumab fulfills an unmet medical need in the treatment of MS.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36027, "infons": {"section_type": "COMP_INT", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Disclosure of conflict of interest", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 36062, "infons": {"section_type": "COMP_INT", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Professor Hutchinson has received consulting fees from Biogen Idec and grant support from Serono, Schering AG, and Biogen Idec.
