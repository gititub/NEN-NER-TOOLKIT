Furthermore, the interaction between the alpha4 integrin and VCAM-1 transforms the phenotype of the lymphocyte causing activation and proliferation. There is a cascade of local cytokines and chemokines that then activate more lymphocytes and further promote adhesion and transmigration of these cells into inflamed tissue. A similar interaction occurs between the alpha4 integrin-expressing lymphocytes and extracellular matrix molecules such as fibronectin and osteopontin, which further propagates inflammation within the brain. Ascertainment of this mechanism led to a significant interest in alpha4 integrin as a target for disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for MS.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3855, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Research on the therapeutic potential of alpha4 integrin inhibitors was conducted in the murine model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Monocytic cell lines from humans, rats, and mice were found to selectively bind to inflamed vessels in brain sections from animals with EAE at day 5 after induction. Human peripheral neutrophils did not bind, as expected given their lack of alpha4 integrin receptors. Binding of human monocytes was nearly completely (>95%) inhibited by pretreatment of the tissue sample with a monoclonal antibody to alpha4 integrin. Intraperitoneal injection of this same antibody 2 days after induction of EAE prevented the paralysis of the experimental animals and reduced the severity of paralysis in animals that did ultimately develop EAE.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4643, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Antibodies to alpha4 integrin were found to block both alpha4beta7 and alpha4beta1 heterodimers.

Two pivotal randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled Phase III trials supported the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of natalizumab for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), and the results are summarized in Table 1. The Natalizumab Safety and Efficacy in Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (AFFIRM) study enrolled 942 RRMS patients, with at least one documented relapse in the prior year, from 99 clinical centers across Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive natalizumab 300 mg intravenously every 4 weeks or placebo infusion. At 1 year, the primary outcome was annualized relapse rate (ARR), and at 2 years, the primary outcome was the cumulative probability of sustained progression of disability, defined as an increase of >=1.0 on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) from a baseline score of >=1.0 or an increase of >=1.5 from a baseline score of 0 that was sustained for 12 weeks. Secondary analyses at both time points included magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) efficacy data and progression of disability as measured by the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC). As compared to placebo, the treatment group showed a 68% reduction in ARR at 1 year (0.26 in the natalizumab group vs 0.81 in the placebo group, P<0.001) and a 42% reduction of the risk of confirmed disability worsening at 2 years (17% vs 29%, P<0.001).
