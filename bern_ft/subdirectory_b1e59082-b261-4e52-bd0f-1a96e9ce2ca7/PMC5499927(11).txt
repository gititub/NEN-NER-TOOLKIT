Overall, the mean ARR for the entire cohort after natalizumab discontinuation was lower than that prior to the initiation of natalizumab, but 83 patients (22%) met the criteria for \"rebound\" of relapses defined as individual post-natalizumab relapse rate higher than their individual relapse rate prior to natalizumab therapy. Fagius et al studied 15 natalizumab-treated patients who stopped therapy as compared with 55 historical control patients on first-line DMT with cessation of therapy. The proportion of patients with relapses in the natalizumab-treated cohort was twice that of patients in the first-line DMT group (P=0.013). Five of the natalizumab-treated patients exhibited \"rebound\" activity as defined in this study as relapse with larger EDSS increase or larger volume of gadolinium-enhancing lesions than ever seen in the individual patient. This study is limited, though, by its retrospective controls and significant differences between the two study groups, most notably a higher mean ARR in the natalizumab treatment group in the year prior to starting therapy (2.3+-1.2) compared with the first-line DMT group (ARR of 1.7+-0.9). The authors propose several hypotheses to explain the rebound phenomena including that the increase in circulating proinflammatory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with natalizumab therapy leads to attack on the CNS when the drug is discontinued and there is removal of alpha4 integrin blockade. There is also speculation that natalizumab may have an \"arresting effect\" on the natural maturation of the immune system that typically causes MS patients to have a less inflammatory course in older age. Furthermore, there are case reports of significant rebound of MS disease activity after discontinuation of natalizumab with evidence of numerous gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI and severe relapses, including some that have been fatal.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 42198, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Contrary to these findings, several larger studies, including a randomized study of 175 patients randomized to continue or discontinue natalizumab and an observational prospective multicenter study including over 4,000 patients, failed to prove a true rebound effect. Rather, these studies demonstrate that patients are prone to return to pre-natalizumab disease activity levels upon its discontinuation. A Phase IIb study of 213 natalizumab-treated MS patients demonstrated return of gadolinium-enhancing lesions and relapses after treatment interruption, but no rebound activity was seen above the level in patients who received placebo. In addition, a large cohort of 1,866 natalizumab-treated patients from the AFFIRM, SENTINEL, and GLANCE trials were examined during treatment interruption when natalizumab was voluntarily removed from the market. During the at least 8 months of treatment interruption, disease activity never exceeded the levels observed in the placebo-treated subjects in the clinical trials. This discussion of the possibility of rebound MS activity has also led to the consideration of optimal timing for initiation of the new DMT, which thus far favors a shorter washout interval.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 43406, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Conclusion", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 43417, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Natalizumab remains an important part of the treatment arsenal for patients with RRMS. It has proven to be highly efficacious in the reduction of clinical relapses and prevention of new MRI activity.

Risk mitigation awareness and development of a formal monitoring program have encouraged careful prescribing of natalizumab, though the risk of PML has not been fully eliminated. Future work continues into the development of new biomarkers that may better predict an individual's risk of PML and further improve upon natalizumab's safety.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 44063, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Disclosure", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 44074, "infons": {"section_type": "CONCL", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.
