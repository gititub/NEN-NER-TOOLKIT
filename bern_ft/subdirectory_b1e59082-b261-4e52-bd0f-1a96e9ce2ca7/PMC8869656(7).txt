PGC-1alpha maintains energy homeostasis and regulates the expression of insulin signaling, mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics, and antioxidant genes, including uncoupling proteins, and thus prevents mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic disorders related to adipocyte malfunction. Dysregulation of PGC-1alpha alters homeostasis in cells and exacerbates the inflammatory response, which is commonly accompanied by metabolic disturbances. During adipocyte dysfunction, low degrees of PGC-1alpha downregulate mitochondrial quality articulation, instigate irritation and oxidative pressure, and advance atomic factor kappa-B actuation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22080, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "PGC-1alpha quality treatment facilitated improved fat tissue work and had a positive and beneficial effect on distal organs like the liver, suggesting that focusing on PGC-1alpha quality treatment is an alluring remedial methodology for improving insulin affectability, insulin processing, metabolic movement and vascular capacity in metabolic disorders.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22435, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "4.10. Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gama (PPAR )", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 22498, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "One of the most important nuclear targets for TZDs is PPAR . Originally, it was considered the positive regulator of adipogenesis with higher expression in adipose tissues, though it is also expressed in many other tissues and body cells of the body but to a lesser extent. It has been observed that specific deletion of PPAR  from different cell targets:such as adipose tissue, muscle, macrophages, and the brain:alters glucose homeostasis, which in turn reduces the activity of TZDs. PPAR  is well known for both promoting and secreting adiponectin which is considered an important insulin sensitizing hormone. It is a well-known transcription factor that regulates the functions of many genes both positively and negatively. However, fully understanding PPAR 's role and how it controls insulin sensitivity is still elusive. Despite many side effects, which include heart failure, weight gain, bladder cancer, plasma volume expansion, and others, it is still considered an important target. Understanding its mechanism and exploring its downstream pathway is of great interest. Epigenetic modifications or post translational modification in PPAR 's structure are thought to be promising routes in the treatment of various metabolic diseases. Various studies, including those on its phosphorylation at S273 or sumoylation at Lys107, have already demonstrated its importance in mediating insulin sensitizing actions. Sirtuins-mediated changes in PPAR  also were beneficial in metabolic syndrome.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24009, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "4.11. Glucocorticoid Receptor", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24039, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The glucocorticoid receptor has a distinct effect on insulin action with both endogenous as well exogenous synthetic glucocorticoids. In general, glucocorticoids increase the blood glucose levels when required by the brain, but chronic activation of these receptors is associated with metabolic dysfunction, including insulin resistance. Glucocorticoids exhibit their effects either by directly acting on promoter or enhancer sites of the genes or by acting on other transcription factors and making a complex. Homodimerization and direct binding are associated with insulin resistance, affecting many gluconeogenic genes such as Pck1 and G6pc. Chronic activation of these receptors inhibits protein synthesis and favors proteolysis. This ultimately releases amino acids and acts as substrate for glucose production. While the precise mechanism for how these receptors regulate insulin resistance is still unknown, many studies show that GR activation inhibits insulin stimulated glucose uptake by controlling many downstream targets.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 25074, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "4.12.
