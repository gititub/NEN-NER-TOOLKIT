Onset is usually subacute, occurring over several weeks, and is progressive (compared with the typical acute onset of an MS relapse). Clinical presentation can include visual change and motor or behavioural changes. Recent changes in behaviour or personality, hemiparesis, language disturbances, retrochiasmal visual deficits and onset of seizures should alert the clinician to possible PML. Relatives may notice subtle changes that are not apparent to the clinician. PML lesions can be detected on MRI scans. In a review of 22 of the first 40 post-marketing cases of PML, the most frequent lesion pattern in early scans from PML patients was that of large (>3 cm, 15/18), subcortical (18/18), T2 or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintense (18/18), T1-hypointense (17/18), and diffusion-hyperintense (15/15) lesions, with a sharp border towards the grey matter and an ill-defined border toward the white matter (18/18) on T2-weighted images. Contrast enhancement was detected in 41% (7/17) of the cases on the first scan at clinical presentation. A diagnosis of PML can usually be confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis using JCV DNA amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity approximating 100%.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18708, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "PML is treated by immune reconstitution. Plasma exchange rapidly reduces natalizumab concentrations in serum and restores leukocyte function. Several courses of plasma exchange or immunoadsorption have been used to eliminate natalizumab in post-marketing PML cases. However, this treatment is often followed by immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which can lead to serious neurological complications or death. IRIS can be successfully treated with high-dose steroids; prophylaxis of IRIS with corticosteroids has not been systematically evaluated, but given the severe nature of IRIS and its consistent presentation in most patients, pre-emptive treatment starting immediately after plasma exchange might be justified.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19443, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Factors that appear to be associated with improved survival in PML patients include younger age at diagnosis, lower pre-PML EDSS score, shorter time from first symptoms to diagnosis and localised PML extension on MRI at diagnosis (i.e. unilobar vs. multilobar or widespread lesions). Recently, several cases have been reported in which PML has been detected by MRI in asymptomatic patients. In a study of patients with natalizumab-associated PML, 7% (21/298) were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Most of these (14/21) remained symptom-free over 13 months of follow-up. Asymptomatic patients experienced significantly less functional disability at diagnosis and at 6 and 12 months post-diagnosis compared with symptomatic PML patients. Over time, EDSS scores were consistently better in asymptomatic PML patients than in symptomatic patients. As of 1 January 2013, 100% of asymptomatic PML patients and 77% of symptomatic PML patients were alive. These preliminary data suggest that functional outcomes and survival may be better in patients whose PML is diagnosed before they develop clinical symptoms.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20555, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Clinical management and positioning of natalizumab", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 20606, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The expert neurologists considered descriptions of several clinical cases and discussed their management.
