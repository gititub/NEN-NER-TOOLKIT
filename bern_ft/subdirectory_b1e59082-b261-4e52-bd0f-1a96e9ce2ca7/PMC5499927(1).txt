It is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Natalizumab demonstrated high efficacy in Phase III trials by reducing the annualized relapse rate, preventing multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion accumulation on magnetic resonance imaging, and decreasing the probability of sustained progression of disability. The leading safety concern with natalizumab is its association with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare brain infection typically seen only in severely immunocompromised patients caused by reactivation of the John Cunningham virus (JCV). Careful analysis of risk factors for PML in natalizumab-treated MS patients, specifi-cally the presence of anti-JCV antibodies, has led to risk mitigation strategies to improve safety. Additional biomarkers are under investigation to further aid risk stratification. Natalizumab's high efficacy and favorable tolerability profile have led to a broad use by MS physicians, as both first-and second-line treatments. This review discusses the natalizumab efficacy, safety, and tolerability and finishes with pragmatic considerations regarding its use in clinical practice.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1400, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1413, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system (CNS) disorder that results in part from inflammatory injury and in part from neurodegeneration. Though the exact pathophysiology of this disease has not been fully elaborated, much is understood about the role of lymphocytes and the accompanying CNS inflammatory cascade that results in demyelination, neuronal damage, and, ultimately, neurological disability. Pathological evaluation has demonstrated a significant role for activated lymphocytes in MS lesions. Within the inflammatory milieu of MS, the brain, cerebrospinal (CSF) and blood lymphocyte levels are increased via clonal expansion of T-cell subsets. Accumulation of lymphocytes in the brain occurs via various methods of transmigration across the blood-brain barrier, making their entry point at the blood-brain barrier a valuable target for MS therapy.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 2287, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In inflammatory states such as MS, endothelial cells that line postcapillary venules are activated by cytokines, and there is enhanced expression of numerous cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) on the vascular endothelium. These in turn enable tethering, rolling, and gripping of circulating lymphocytes to the endothelium, which prepares them for transmigration across the blood-brain barrier. Examples of these CAMs include P- and E-selectins, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). VCAM-1 acts as a ligand for alpha4 integrin receptors expressed mostly on lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils. alpha4 integrins are capable of forming heterodimers with two beta-subunits (beta1 and beta7) to form functional molecules. The association between VCAM-1 and alpha4 integrin facilitates firm adhesion of lymphocytes to the endothelium, which in turn allows for transmigration of the lymphocytes.
