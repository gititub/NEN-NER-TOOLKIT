It is therefore prudent to periodically repeat JCV antibody testing in patients who are initially negative. Most practitioners do this at least every 6 months. Because studies remain preliminary, there is a lack of consensus in the field regarding the utility of the JCV antibody index in routine clinical practice. However, among those practitioners willing to use natalizumab in patients who are initially positive or become positive for JCV antibody, some will periodically check the index to ensure that it remains in the putatively low-risk range. Periodic monitoring for blood count and hepatic function are generally completed every 3 months.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 37332, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "For various practitioners, MRI of patients on natalizumab is generally checked at least yearly in JCV antibody-negative patients and at least every 6 months in positive patients. For those who are JCV antibody positive and have a compelling reason to continue natalizumab past the 1- to 2-year mark, or for those who are early in their natalizumab course but have a high index value, it is reasonable to increase the frequency of imaging to once every 3 months to evaluate for early signs of PML.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 37829, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "When to consider natalizumab discontinuation", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 37874, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "There are several potential scenarios that warrant consideration for discontinuing natalizumab, mostly related to a change in the risk-benefit ratio for continued use of the drug. As described, some practitioners may start a patient who is known to be JCV antibody positive on natalizumab with the knowledge that the risk of PML will at some point outweigh the benefit to staying on natalizumab. Precisely when this threshold is reached varies by risk tolerance level of the individual patient and practitioner as well as by the clinical context. Considered factors include the frequency and severity of exacerbations, disability level, previous therapies the patient has failed or not tolerated, and the patient's eligibility status regarding other high-efficacy therapies for MS. These same considerations apply to a patient who is initially negative for JCV antibody but seroconverts during the treatment course.

There has been concern about the potential for worsening of clinical severity after cessation of natalizumab, including increased relapse rate, relapse severity, and number of new T2 and gadolinium-enhancing lesions, possibly attributable to an IRIS-like phenomenon. Most investigations show that the return of disease activity occurs relatively early after natalizumab discontinuation, but they differ on whether this represents a return to prior baseline disease activity versus a true rebound effect with disease activity more severe than prior to natalizumab initiation.
