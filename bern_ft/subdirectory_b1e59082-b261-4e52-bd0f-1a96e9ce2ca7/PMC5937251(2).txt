Serum antibodies to JCV are found in 50% to 70% of the healthy general population, indicating that JCV is ubiquitous in humans. The JCV encodes the large T antigen (TAg), small T antigen, 3 virus capsid proteins, and an agnoprotein in its genome. The JCV-encoded TAg plays an important role in virus replication by binding to the viral origin of replication through a DNA-binding domain. The nuclear localization signal in TAg recruits TAg to the nucleus, and the helicase domain in TAg unwinds the DNA double helix and promotes viral DNA replication.

Two portals of entry for JCV into the body have been suggested: the tonsils and the gastrointestinal tract. Primary viremia is usually asymptomatic and occurs in childhood. After primary infection, the virus remains in the body in a latent state in the kidneys, tonsils, bone marrow, spleen, brain, lymph nodes, and lungs. Reactivation can occur following immunosuppression or after elimination of the B cells with drugs targeting B cells such as rituximab.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4248, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "It has been suggested that after the initial infection the virus transforms into a neurotropic form by gene rearrangement and replicates in glial tissues. B cells have the capacity to harbor JCV with diverse regulatory regions, including neurotropic JCV. The gene rearrangement in the noncoding control region of the neurotropic JCV permits binding to the NF-1X binding protein that glial cells share with B cells. Therefore, B cells are the logical, though not proven, site of the mutation as they have a unique genetic machinery that facilitates gene rearrangements through the addition and deletion of nucleotides and somatic hypermutation. The cellular immune response is most important in preventing and controlling JCV. There is no evidence that the presence of antibody offers any protection from future infection. On the other hand, the importance of cell-mediated immunity is indicated by the correlation between an impaired Th1-type T helper function and clinical manifestation of PML. The significant role of cytotoxic T lymphocytes directed against JCV in controlling the disease has been established. Given the large number of individuals in general population infected with JCV, rarity of PML indicates that substantial barriers to its development must exist in immunocompetent individuals.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5553, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Diagnosis of PML", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 5570, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is suspected in patients who have subcortical white matter lesions.

The most common diseases associated with PML are HIV, hematological malignancies, and MAB treatment. In the setting of hematological malignancies, a population-based study estimated the PML incidence at 0.07%. These results were based on only 3 cases of PML identified over a period of 11 years in a single Canadian province. Accurate calculation of the risk of PML attributable to the underlying malignancy as opposed to treatment-related immunosuppression is complicated by a rarity of this disease and a few larger clinical.
