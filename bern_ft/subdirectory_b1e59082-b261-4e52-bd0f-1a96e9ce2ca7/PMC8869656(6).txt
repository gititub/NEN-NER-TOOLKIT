Phosphorylation and acetylation are the two most common post translational modifications of FoxO1, where it regulates many gene functions. Phosphorylation of FoxO1 is the main mechanism by which it comes out of the nucleus to get degraded by ubiquitination. The acetylation state of FoxO1 depends upon the balance between the protein acetylases and deacetylases. Even FoxO1 gets activated by O-GlcNAcylation during oxidative stress-like conditions in diabetic livers and increases the activation of many gluconeogenic and ROS detoxifying genes. PGC1-alpha induction during fasting activates the series of gluconeogenesis genes and later directly binds to FoxO1 to phosphorylate and ultimately degrade it out of the nucleus.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 18100, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "4.7.

FFAs are generally divided into three sub-categories based on their chain length as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) and long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs). FFAs of these varying chain lengths are known to activate transmembrane receptors such as FFA1, FFA2, and FFA3. For example, FFA1 are expressed to a large extent on the pancreatic beta-cells and are activated by LCFAs. The activation of these receptors also plays an important role in the increase of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Therefore, because of its obvious role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, a series of FFA1 ligands have been identified and tested. FFA2 and FFA3 are akin to FFA1 receptors and get activated by SCFAs but their role in insulin is complex. FFA2 receptors are highly expressed in immune cells, especially neutrophils. Studies have also identified FFA2 expression on murine pancreatic beta-cell line MIN6 and isolated mouse islets. The indirect support for the role of FFA2 in diabetes comes from the fact that a fiber-rich diet is linked with a lower incidence of diabetes and SCFAs. Ligands for FFA2 are known to be produced by intestinal bacteria in the body by the fermentation of dietary fibers. Tang et al. showed FFA2 and FFA3 expression on human pancreatic beta-cells. These receptors are shown to inhibit insulin secretion by coupling to Gi-type G proteins. They also demonstrated that genetic deletion of FFA2 and FFA3 receptors in pancreatic beta-cells leads to higher insulin secretion in HFD animals, whereas similar deletion in intestinal cells did not affect glucose tolerance in diabetic animals. This study demonstrated that FFA2/FFA3 antagonists may prove beneficial in T2DM.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19896, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "4.8.

The cytochrome p450 enzyme is responsible for the formation of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) and EETs.
