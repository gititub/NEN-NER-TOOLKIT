After recovering from such periods, even with an increased availability of higher quality foods, sugar consumption has become an integral part of their daily dietary habits.

According to the 2017 National Diabetes Statistics Report, about 30.3 million people in the U.S. are diabetic and surprisingly some 23.8% are undiagnosed. The latest 2019 statistics by the IDF are shown in Table 1. However, in countries like India, the dominant factor contributing to the prevalence of diabetes is an underdeveloped health services system, as 70% of the Indian population lives in poorly serviced rural areas. Widespread illiteracy and unfamiliarity with healthier nutritional habits only serve to exacerbate the situation. These factors contribute to inadequate diabetes screening and availability of preventive measures, as well as non-adherence to diabetes management guidelines once diagnosed. Less physical activity and sedentary lifestyles may also contribute to obesity and T2DM. Correspondingly, increased physical activity has been shown to help maintain glucose homeostasis in the body and to delay the onset of impaired glucose tolerance.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 4494, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "2.

The first reference to diabetes was in 1550 B.C. in an Egyptian papyrus, where it was described as a rare disease characterized by excessive weight loss and frequent urination. The term diabetes (to siphon or to pass through, in Greek) was first used by Apollonius of Memphis, who noted that patients with diabetes present with frequent urination. A Greek physician, Galen, hypothesized it to be a type of kidney disease, as the most prominent symptom was glucosuria. Avicenna (980-1037) offered a comprehensive description of diabetes mellitus in his publication \"The Canon of Medicine\" in 1025. Eventually, owing to its characteristic symptoms, many tests to more fully identify the disease were developed in the late 11th century, involving the examination of the subject's urine's color, odor and taste. The sweet taste of a diabetic patient's urine apparently led to its second name, mellitus (honey, in Latin). Later in the 19th century, Matthew Dobson discovered that the excessive amount of sugar in the urine of patients with diabetes gives it that sweet taste. He also provided an important distinction between the two different types of diabetes, which are now referred to as type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Banting and Macleod observed a reduction in blood glucose levels after administering islets of Langerhans to a pancreatectomized dog, and for this breakthrough discovery they were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1923. Eli Lilly acquired the first deal to produce insulin on a commercial level. Gradually, by the late 20th century, as the mechanisms behind diabetes started to unfold, various insulin preparations and other oral hypoglycemic drugs paved their way onto the market.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 6296, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "At present, based on insulin deficiency and insensitivity of cells towards insulin, diabetes is classified into three major types, described below.
