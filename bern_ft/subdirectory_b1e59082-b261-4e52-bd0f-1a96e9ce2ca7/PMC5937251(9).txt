Mefloquine, a drug approved for malaria therapy, has recently shown to have an effect on the activity of JCV in a screening bioassay when it is applied on a human glial cell line infected with JCV. Mirtazapine, an inhibitor of 5-HT2a receptor, which may be used by JCV for cell entry, has also been shown to inhibit the infection of a human astroglial cell line. Recently, an anecdotal report has shown the efficacy of mirtazapine in a patient with PML, although many experts doubt that this therapeutic agent has substantial efficacy. At the present time, if PML is discovered in a patient and due to discontinuation of MAB, the medication is the most appropriate action. The use of other medications to try to aid in the treatment of PML reactivation is currently experimental and patients should be referred to tertiary care centers for care or be placed on clinical trials.
