A 197 bp PCR product was amplified using the primers 5' TGG AAT TCC TTT TAT TGA AAC ATC A 3' and 5' GAT TAA GAA GCA ATG CCC TCT C 3'. Following PCR amplification, PCR products were digested with Mse1 for 2 h at 37 C and analysed on 8% polyacrylamide gels as described above. Samples without the K-Ras codon 146 mutation were digested to produce bands of 101, 91 and 5 bp, whereas samples homozygous for the codon 146 mutation produced bands of 91, 78, 23 and 5 bp.
