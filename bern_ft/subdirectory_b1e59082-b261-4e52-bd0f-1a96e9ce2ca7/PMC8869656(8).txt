Due to its different roles in various diseases, it is predicted to be an important target in drug discovery. With concern to type 2 patients with diabetes, a significant difference was found in the genotypic and allelic frequencies of four SNPs of the NFE2L2 gene. In addition, one study involved induction of NRF2 in obese diabetic db/db mice, displaying a decreased blood glucose level by suppressing hepatic glucose 6 phosphatase via cAMP-CREB signaling. Leptin deficient mice showed decreased expression of NRF2 and displayed reduced amounts of white fat mass. This suggests that NRF2 is a key player in adipogenesis or in other metabolic disorders. It has been postulated that NRF2 levels can be increased with an acute dose of glucose, but chronic glucose conditions failed to activate it. Expression is also downregulated in prediabetes patients. NRF2-mediated protection is well defined in the dysfunction of diabetic retinopathy as well. NRF2 knockdown enhances the palmitate-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes of obese patients.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26251, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "4.13.

It was thought that GLP-1 amide, which is the major circulation form in plasma, is the c-terminal metabolite which originates after the enzymatic cleavage of incretin hormone GLP-1 amide by dipeptidyl peptidase-4. These new metabolites also were considered to have an insulinomimetic activity that contributes to the pleiotropic effects of GLP1, other than its canonical GLP-1R. It has been found that direct administration of these metabolites has antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and proliferative effects on pancreatic beta-cells by modulating energy homeostasis. It has been reported that these metabolites preserve mitochondrial function, inhibit membrane depolarization and caspase activation and hence, apoptosis of INS-1 beta-cells. The effect of these metabolites on diabetes is further demonstrated by the administration of GLP-1 amide, which increases beta-cell mass and proliferation by activation of the cAMP/PKA signaling cascade and phosphorylation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27526, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "5.

Consequently, current FDA guidelines necessitate that all new diabetic therapeutics should demonstrate protective or at least neutral cardiovascular impact profiles. In this way, targets of sub-atomic pathways conceivably involved in both diabetes and CVD are particularly attractive. Such methodologies incorporate the focusing of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1), GPR119, TGR5, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), the sodium-glucose co-carrier 2 (SGLT2), and GPR40, for every one of which the reasoning is briefly depicted below (Table 3).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28368, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Taken together, these clinical findings give convincing evidence that various inhibitors, activators, agonists, and antagonists hold promise as new treatments for T2DM and related metabolic disorders.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 28569, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "6.
