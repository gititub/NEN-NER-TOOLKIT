The literature shows that the progression of the neurologic features of PML continues after withdrawing these drugs. This may be due to immune reconstitution. More data are needed to truly know whether PML reactivation is as common with JAK inhibitors as some classical MABs targeting B cells.

We see that the incidence of PML in patients on natalizumab therapy is very comparable to that in HIV-positive population. From a clinical perspective, it is important to know how to prevent PML reactivation. For this, we have to understand the main risk factors for the development of PML for patients on MAB. The presence of immunosuppression, anti-JCV antibodies, and duration of immunosuppression are the 3 most important reasons for PML reactivation. At this time, a quantitative anti-JCV antibody index is currently being investigated to determine its predictive value in detecting PML and to show whether increasing titers could reflect an increasing risk. Initial interpretations of this serological test suggested that a negative status could be used to reassure patients as the probability of developing PML is very low at <1/10 000. Long-term studies like the AFFIRM and STRATIFY-1 suggest that the serological status could change during MAB treatment and thus needed continuous monitoring every 6 months.
