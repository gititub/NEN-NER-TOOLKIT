In SENTINEL, combination therapy was associated with a somewhat higher incidence of anxiety (12% vs 8% in patients receiving IFNbeta-1a alone), pharyngitis (7% vs 4%), sinus congestion (6% vs 3%), and peripheral edema (5% vs 1%) (all p <= 0.05). In both AFFIRM and SENTINEL, infections and serious AEs occurred at a low and comparable incidence between treatment groups, except that MS relapses were significantly reduced among patients receiving natalizumab.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26719, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Two cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare brain disorder; were diagnosed in patients with MS who received natalizumab, in combination with IFNbeta-1a, in the SENTINEL study. A third case of PML, previously diagnosed as astrocytoma, was later identified post-mortem in a patient with Crohn's disease (CD) who had received immunosuppressive treatment in addition to natalizumab (Van Assche et al 2005). Natalizumab may allow the development of PML by reducing the transmigration of lymphocytes into the CNS and thus prevent or attenuate CNS immunosurveillance, however other immune mechanisms may be involved. Natalizumab was withdrawn from the market in February 2005 and ongoing studies were suspended; patients who had received natalizumab were invited to participate in screening for other cases of PML. Based on this patient population, who received a mean of approximately 18 monthly doses of natalizumab, it was estimated that the incidence of PML was 1 case per 1000 patients over 18 months (95% CI 0.2-2.8).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27764, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_3"}, "text": "Immunogenicity", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 27779, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "An immune response to protein therapeutic agents will lead to the development of neutralizing antibodies in a proportion of patients; most natalizumab clinical studies assessed patients for the presence of natalizumab-reactive antibodies in serum. In the AFFIRM and SENTINEL Phase 3 studies, 6% of patients developed persistent antinatalizumab antibodies, which were associated with an increase in infusion-related AEs and a decrease in the efficacy of natalizumab. In the AFFIRM study, antibodies were detected in 57 of 625 (9%) of natalizumab-treated patients: 20 (3%) were transiently positive and 37 (6%) were persistently positive. Persistently positive patients showed a loss of clinical efficacy as measured by disability progression (p <= 0.05), relapse rate (p = 0.009), and MRI (p <= 0.05) compared with antibody-negative patients. In transiently positive patients, full efficacy was achieved after approximately 6 months of treatment, the time when patients were becoming antibody negative.

In the former case, patients should have had at least one relapse in the previous year while on therapy and have >=9 T2 lesions or >=1 Gd+ lesion on cranial MRI; in the latter case, patients should have had two or more disabling relapses in one year and >=1 Gd+ lesion or an increase T2 lesion load relative to another recent cranial MRI scan.
