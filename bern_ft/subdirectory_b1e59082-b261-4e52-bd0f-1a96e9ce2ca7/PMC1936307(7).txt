Because the mechanism of action of GA may depend on Th2 lymphocytes entering the CNS, a process blocked by natalizumab, concern arose about possible interference between the two therapies. To investigate the consequences of combining GA and natalizumab therapies, the GLANCE (Glatiramer Acetate and Natalizumab Combination Evaluation) study was conducted (Table 2). This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter safety trial enrolled 110 patients with RRMS who had been treated with GA (>=20 mg/day) for at least 1 year and who had experienced at least one relapse during this time. All patients continued to receive GA and also received either placebo or natalizumab 300 mg, administered by IV infusion every 4 weeks for up to 20 weeks.

Inclusion criteria required the patients to be aged 18 to 50 years, have MRI lesions consistent with MS, EDSS score of 0.0 to 5.0, and at least one relapse within the previous 12 months. Patients who experienced a relapse within 50 days before the first dose of study medication were excluded. The primary endpoints were the rate of clinical relapses at 1 year and the rate of sustained progression of disability at 2 years. Disability progression was defined as a >=1.0-point increase in EDSS score from a baseline EDSS score >=1.0 (or a >=1.5-point increase in patients with a baseline EDSS score of 0) that was sustained for 12 weeks. At 1 year and over 2 years, natalizumab reduced the mean annualized relapse rate by 68% compared with placebo (p < 0.001). Over 2 years, the risk of sustained disability progression was reduced by 42% in the natalizumab group compared with the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.43-0.77; p < 0.001). Natalizumab decreased the mean number of new or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions by 83% over 2 years and the mean number of Gd+ lesions by 92% at 2 years, compared with placebo (both p < 0.001).
