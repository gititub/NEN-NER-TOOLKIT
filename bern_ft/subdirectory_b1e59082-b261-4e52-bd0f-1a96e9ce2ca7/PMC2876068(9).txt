The Raf-inhibitors PLX4720 and PLX4032 have the preclinical characteristics of functioning as specific inhibitors of the BRAFV600E mutated kinase with a favorable profile compared to wild type kinases. Understanding the patterns of sensitivity and resistance in melanomas with different oncogenic events is of high importance for clinical translation. Our studies confirmed the high specificity of PLX4032 for a subset of BRAFV600E mutant cell lines. Surprisingly, we noted differences in the sensitivity to PLX4032, with some BRAFV600E mutants demonstrating resistance to the cytotoxic effects of PLX4032. In most cases, these cells had a tendency towards slower growth kinetics and being heterozygous for BRAFV600E.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 24246, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "This differential response to PLX4032 in BRAFV600E mutant melanoma cell lines may be explained by several mechanisms. It may be that there is preferential MAPK pathway-addiction in sensitive cell lines, and cells with lower sensitivity are less dependent on the BRAFV600E oncogenic signaling, relying on the co-activation of other signaling pathways including the PI3K/Akt pathway. We explored this possibility with SNP arrays and high throughput oncogene sequencing with a particular interest in looking at this pathway. The genomic analysis revealed that alterations in PI3K/Akt, including deletions of PTEN, amplifications of AKT and activating mutations in AKT were distributed throughout the cell line list with no clear pattern of correlation with sensitivity or resistance to PLX4032. However, in two cell lines phospho-specific Western blot staining suggested that the resistant cell line had increased Akt signaling upon PLX4032 exposure. Another possibility is that PLX4032-resistant BRAFV600E mutants have alternative signaling at the level of Raf, as has been described for cell lines with acquired resistance to a different Raf-inhibitor, AZ628, which show increased signaling through C-Raf. The increase in pErk in an NRAS Q61L mutant cell line could be explained by abrogation of negative feedback loops mediated mainly by dual specificity phosphatases (MKPs/DUSPs), as reported with Mek inhibitors, and the recent description of increased C-Raf signaling when heterodimerizing with inhibited B-Raf in BRAF wild type cells. Therefore, the modulation of feed-back loops and alteration of Raf dimerization upon treatment with Raf inhibitors may also have a role in the differential sensitivity to PLX4032 in BRAFV600E mutant cell lines. Finally, differences in expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic molecules like Bim and Bad may allow some BRAFV600E mutant cell lines to undergo growth arrest but not die from apoptosis upon exposure to PLX4032. Studies are ongoing to further explore these possibilities.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 26266, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We explored the use of PET imaging as a mean to non-invasively detect PLX4032-sensitivity. In vitro we found that any of the three PET tracers FDG, FLT and FAC could be used to distinguish between melanomas with a NRAS or a BRAFV600E mutation based on the differential effects of PLX4032 on cell cycle and metabolism. FDG could furthermore be used to distinguish between BRAFV600E mutant melanomas with high or low sensitivity to PLX4032. The PI3K/Akt pathway has been widely regarded as having a role in the regulation of glucose metabolism through mTOR, but recently the LKB1-AMPK pathway has been found to be regulated by oncogenic BRAFV600E signaling, which together may explain the marked and rapid effects of PLX4032 on inhibiting FDG uptake. We explored this possibility in two cell lines. Our data suggests a minor increase in pAMPK upon PLX4032 exposure, which may be in line with the proposed hypothesis.
