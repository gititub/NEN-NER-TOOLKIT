Sections were deparaffinised using an automated protocol on a Vysis VP2000 processor, placed into a coplin-containing pre-warmed pre-treatment solution (Vysis, Maidenhead, Kent, UK) and incubated at 80 C for 30 min. Slides were then washed at room temperature in water for 1 min, before two 5 min washes in 2 x SSC before digestion with protease buffer at 37 C for 65 min. Following digestion, slides were washed three times in 2 x SSC for 2 min, before sequential washes in 70, 85 and 100% ethanol for 2 min each at room temperature and dried on a 37 C block. Meanwhile, 1 mul chromosome 12p BAC RP11-707G18 (Red) (BlueGnome), 1 mul chromosome 12q BAC RP11-89H19 (Green) (BlueGnome) and 9 mul LSI-WCP hybridisation buffer (Vysis) was mixed together for each slide and pipetted onto a 22 x 22 mm coverslip which was placed onto a region of the slide containing tumour tissue and placed onto a heat block at 75 C for 5 min to co-denature the probes and tumour tissue. Rubber cement was then applied to seal the coverslips and slides placed into a humidified hybridisation chamber in a 37 C incubator overnight. The next morning, coverslips were removed and slides placed into 0.4 x SSC at 72 C for 90 s and transferred to 2 x SSC containing 0.005% Tween for 30 s before being left to dry in the dark. In all, 20 mul of DAPI stain was then applied to coverslips, which were then gently applied to each slide and, after removing air bubbles, sealed with clear nail varnish.
