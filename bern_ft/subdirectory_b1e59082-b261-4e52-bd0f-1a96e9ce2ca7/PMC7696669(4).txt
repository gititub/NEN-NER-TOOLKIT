The excipients available for the testing included sodium carboxymethyl starch (type A), povidone (K30), colloidal silica (anhydrous), corn starch, and magnesium stearate. The recovery of NDMA in each substance was verified. The recovery in the excipient analysis was 87.75%, 108.50%, 98.52%, 80.76%, and 85.58%, respectively. Therefore, we concluded that the method can be used to control the excipients.

There are a number of available instrumental methods for NAs analysis, and the methods of the gas and liquid chromatography are the most popular choice.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 12775, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The selection of a column for gas chromatography can include non-polar columns (e.g., 5% phenyl-methylpolysiloxane, HP-5MS and DB-5MS), intermediate polarity columns (e.g., 35% phenyl-methylpolysiloxane, HP-35MS) and high polarity columns (e.g., polyethylene glycol, DB-WAX and TG-WAX). Analysis of NAs requires very low detection limits, and therefore, the use of mass spectrometry, preferably with the MS/MS mode, is the obvious choice. The ionization sources previously used in the analysis of NAs include electron impact (EI) with MS/MS mode and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) with positive chemical ionization (PCI) using methanol, acetonitrile, ammonia, or methane as the reagent gas. CI has been shown to yield better specificity than that of EI and CI, thus provides higher sensitivity in the NAs analysis. However, EI remains the most popular choice for GC-MS/MS, due to its ability of simultaneous identification by comparing the registered spectra with the spectra stored in the mass spectra library. Alternatively, The NA analysis can be performed using liquid chromatography on a reversed-phase column (mainly C8 or C18) using a combination of electrospray ionization (ESI) or atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) as ionization method used in a mass spectrometer. However, in addition to chromatography and mass spectrometry, sample preparation is an important part of NAs analysis; in the case of GC, the injection method is also important. Injection of the samples onto the GC system for NAs analysis can use classical split/splitless, programmed temperature or cold injector, thermal desorption (TD), or headspace (HS) injection. Sample preparation can involve distillation, liquid-liquid extraction, and/or SPE. However, various pitfalls of complex sample preparation steps have been reported in the analysis of NAs in various matrices.
