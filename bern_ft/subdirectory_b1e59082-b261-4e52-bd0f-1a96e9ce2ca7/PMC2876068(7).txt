Using a BRAFV600E mutant melanoma cell line with a good response to PLX4032 (M249) and another one that was poorly responsive to PLX4032 (M233) based on cell viability assays, we analyzed apoptotic induction using flow cytometry based on the incorporation of propidium iodide and Annexin V. After PLX4032-treatment, the increase in Annexin V positive cells, with or without being double positive for propidium iodide, was greater in the PLX4032-responsive M249 cells compared to the poorly responding M233 cells (Figure 2D and 2E). Similar results were obtained with M238 and M263 (data not shown). Taken together with the data on cell cycle inhibition, these data suggest that PLX4032 has cytostatic effects in BRAFV600E mutant cell lines with a poor response, while it has cytostatic and cytotoxic effects in cell lines with a good response to PLX4032 in cell viability assays.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 16749, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Functional and genomic characterization of BRAFV600E mutated cell lines with different sensitivity to PLX4032", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 16859, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "We tested if the differences in sensitivity to PLX4032 were due to markedly different doubling times. Resistant BRAFV600E mutated cell lines tended to have a slower doubling time compared to the sensitive BRAFV600E mutated cell lines (P = 0.24, Table 1). The lack of significance was due to outliers in a small group, most notably the highly sensitive cell line M262 having a doubling time close to 50 hours. Interestingly, all cell lines homozygous for the BRAFV600E mutation were moderately to highly sensitive to PLX4032, and cell lines resistant to PLX4032 were all heterozygous for BRAFV600E (P = 0.16). However, there were also two highly sensitive heterozygous cell lines with IC50 values below 1 muM of PLX4032, and the sensitivity of homozygous cell lines spreads through one-log differences in PLX4032 concentrations (Table 1). We then used high throughput analysis of over 500 gene mutations using mass-spectrometry based genotyping and high-density SNP arrays to explore other genomic alterations. Two different platforms (Illumina and Affymetrix) gave highly concordant results (data not shown) demonstrating that out of the 10 cell lines with BRAFV600E mutation, four have amplification of the BRAF locus (Table 1). There was no clear relationship between these amplification events and the BRAFV600E zygosity or the sensitivity to PLX4032. There were very few secondary mutations in this group of cell lines, with one cell line having a mutation in EGFR, and one cell line with a mutation in AKT (Table 1). In addition, the M257 cell line, which is wild type for both NRAS and BRAF and is highly resistant to PLX4032, was found to have 3 copies of wild type BRAF and a point mutation in CDKN2A. The distribution of amplification events in MITF and EGFR were also spread among the cell lines. Of note, there was no clear trend regarding the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway based on activating mutations, or amplifications of AKT1/2 segregating the resistant and sensitive cell lines. Supervised hierarchical clustering comparing SNP array data from PLX4032-resistant and -sensitive BRAFV600E mutant cell lines did not point to specific genomic areas with concordant alterations differentiating the two groups of cell lines.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19100, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Modulation of MAPK and PI3k/Akt signaling pathways in sensitive and resistant cell lines", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19189, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "To further explore how cell lines with BRAFV600E mutation respond differently to PLX4032 we chose two extreme examples of cell lines with similar growth kinetics to perform an extended analysis of signaling pathways (Figure 3). M229 is one of the two most sensitive cell lines, while M233 proved to be very resistant despite having a short in vitro doubling time (Table 1).
