It is important to the scientific community to focus on the factors that may be involved in those early stages of improvement to advance T2DM research. To these ends, various groups have already started enrolling cohorts of obese diabetic and non-diabetic patients in a gastric banding trial. Blood and tissue samples will be collected from these patients (and a complementary control arm) at the time of the surgical procedure and then longitudinally during a five-year follow-up. The clinical and laboratory findings from this and other ongoing trials will no doubt contribute to advancing our therapeutic approaches to the management of diabetes and other metabolic disorders (Table 4).", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 38345, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "footnote"}, "text": "Publisher's Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 38471, "infons": {"section_type": "AUTH_CONT", "type": "title"}, "text": "Author Contributions", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 38492, "infons": {"section_type": "AUTH_CONT", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Conceptualization, S.P.S., methodology, P.S., N.K., S.B.; software, P.S., N.K., S.B.; validation, S.P.S., N.K., S.A. and A.K.; formal analysis, S.P.S.; investigation, A.K.; resources, P.S., N.K., S.B.; data curation, S.P.S.; writing:original draft preparation, S.P.S., S.B.; writing:review and editing, S.P.S., S.A., A.K.; visualization, A.K.; supervision, S.P.S.; project administration, S.P.S., S.A., A.K.; funding acquisition, S.A.
