Fifty-seven patients from the AFFIRM trial given natalizumab (9%) were found to have detectable antibodies to natalizumab and in those with persistent antibodies there was an increase in infusion-related adverse events and loss of efficacy of the drug. Anti-natalizumab antibodies were neutralizing in vitro, and their presence was associated with a reduction in serum natalizumab levels. Infusion-related reactions most often seen in patients with persistent antibody positivity included urticaria, rigors, nausea, vomiting, headache, flushing, dizziness, pruritus, tremor, feeling cold, pyrexia, myalgia, hypertension, dyspnea, anxiety, and tachycardia.

Animal studies have demonstrated transplacental crossing of natalizumab with potential for fetal harm, including reduced pup survival in guinea pig studies and mild anemia or thrombocytopenia in monkeys with supratherapeutic doses of natalizumab. The Tysabri Pregnancy Exposure Registry prospectively enrolled 369 patients with MS and seven patients with Crohn's disease on natalizumab or with natalizumab exposure within 3 months of conception. Three-hundred and fifty five of the enrolled patients had known pregnancy outcomes. This observational study yielded a major birth defect rate of 5.05% (95% CI 2.9%-8.1%) in natalizumab-exposed patients, which was higher than that seen in the general population as calculated by the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP), but no specific pattern of malformation was found.

Though there have not been head-to-head randomized trials demonstrating superiority to other agents, natalizumab is generally accepted as a high-efficacy therapy for MS and is very well-tolerated. It therefore remains a desirable therapy despite the risk of PML. Its initial use was mainly as a second-line therapy for patients who failed injectables (IFN and glatiramer acetate), and certainly it is still used in this way today as part of \"escalation\" strategy. This is safest in patients who are negative for JCV antibody, but some MS experts also consider escalating to natalizumab in patients who are positive for JCV antibody (and who have not previously been treated with immunosuppressants) with the plan to limit the number of infusions and change the therapy at some point in the future. This strategy may not be without its own risks, separate from PML (see the section on natalizumab discontinuation below). In addition, because the risk for PML in JCV antibody-negative patients is exceedingly small, many MS experts offer the use of natalizumab as a first-line therapy, especially, though not exclusively, for patients with an aggressive presentation.
