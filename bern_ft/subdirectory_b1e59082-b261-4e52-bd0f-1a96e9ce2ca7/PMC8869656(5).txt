Tyrosine phosphorylation in the insulin-receptor activation loop is an important step in insulin signal transduction. PTP1B dephosphorylates phosphor-tyrosine residues of insulin receptor kinase activation segments leading to negative regulation of insulin signaling. The evidence further suggests a relationship between PTP1B, insulin sensitivity, obesity and T2DM. PTP1B is also a negative regulator for leptin signaling. Leptin is a hormone primarily involved in maintaining metabolic homeostasis, and in obesity a decreased sensitivity to leptin results in the inability to attain satiety despite having good energy stores. PTP1B also plays an important part in pancreatic beta-cell proliferation. For example, Fernandez-Ruiz et al. found that that PTP1B knockout mice have a higher proliferation of beta-cells and elevated glucose-induced insulin secretion. These studies are strongly suggestive of the role of PTP1B in diabetes, and thus interest for PTP1B inhibitors, resulting in the search for and development of several inhibitors of this protein. Detailed descriptions of the reported PTP1B inhibitors can be found elsewhere.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 14896, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "4.4.

These diabetes-associated haplotypes caused a decrease in SLC16A11 expression in the liver and disrupted interaction with basigin, which reduced the cell surface localization of SLC16A11. SLC16A11 knockdown in primary human hepatocytes leads to modulation of fatty acid and lipid metabolism. This modulation increases intracellular acylcarnitine, diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol levels which results in increased triglycerides in blood circulation and an accumulation in liver tissue. The increased levels of triglycerides are implicated in insulin resistance, so variants of SLC16A11 may increase the risk of diabetes by regulating lipid metabolism. However, many questions remain unanswered, for example, what the unique substrates are that are associated with the transport of mediators targeting the physiological and biochemical mechanisms that affect T2DM.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 15964, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "4.5.

Its presence is noted in a variety of human tissues and biological fluids such as the musculoskeletal system, kidneys, and cerebrospinal fluid. The average plasma levels of CCN3 have a strong correlation with hs-CRP, BMI, and fat mass, and are elevated significantly in obese patients with hyperlipidemia. Martinerie et al. demonstrated that CCN3 deficiency in mice fed with standard high-fat diets markedly lowered their body weight, and improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Moreover, Li et al. investigated the serum CCN3 levels in newly diagnosed T2DM (nT2DM) patients and compared it with healthy control subjects. It was observed that CCN3 levels were significantly elevated in T2DM patients. These data suggest CCN3 may be involved in obesity-associated insulin-resistance and can serve as an important target for a T2DM therapeutic.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 16982, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "4.6.
