It is a chronic and multifactorial disease. Earlier this was also called Non-insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM), but this term is no longer used because insulin is often used in the management of NIDDM. T2DM is believed to be caused by the gradual development of cells resistant towards insulin and beta-cell dysfunction, although the exact mechanism remains unclear. Being overweight or obese is a major risk factor for T2DM, as it may increase the likelihood of insulin resistance. This in turn will decrease uptake of glucose in, for example, the heart or musculoskeletal tissues, with simultaneous increase in glucose production in organs such as the liver. To counter this, insulin secretion is enhanced by beta-cells. Therefore, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia often coexist during early T2DM. In later stages of the disease, beta-cell function is also diminished. Thus, therapeutics that target beta-cell functioning and decrease insulin resistance are key treatments in T2DM. Some of the factors that control beta-cell functioning include oxidative stress, ER-stress and autophagy. Over the years, researchers have worked on various targets to moderate the onset or worsening of diabetes in their patients, out of which many turned into drug targets.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 8181, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "2.3.

T2DM is the most common type of diabetes, and due to its complex pathogenesis, the ideal treatment for T2DM has been difficult to find. Several studies have reported compounds that improved insulin's action on target tissues and helped restore beta-cell function. In the last decade, many targets have been discovered as new oral agents for T2DM patients. Among these, four major target types are known as insulin secretagogues, insulin mimickers and sensitizers, and starch blockers.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 9328, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "3.1.

There are two types: sulfonylureas and non-sulfonylureas. Sulphonylureas (SU) bind to the sulphonylurea receptors on pancreatic beta-cells and stimulate them to secrete insulin. SU have shown good efficacy in reducing glycated hemoglobin microvasculature complications in patients with T2DM. However, their major drawback is prolonged binding time to the beta-cells, which results in prolonged insulin release. The non-sulfonylureas also stimulate beta-cells to secrete insulin, but they are short acting. In 2004, Jean-Claude Henquin proposed five potential action sites for insulin secretagogue beta-cell metabolism activation: increased blocking of beta-cell KATP channels; increase in intracellular (Ca2+) concentration by means other than KATP channels; activation of various amplifying pathways in beta-cells; action on beta-cell membrane receptors; and action on beta-cell nuclear receptors.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 10332, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "3.2.
