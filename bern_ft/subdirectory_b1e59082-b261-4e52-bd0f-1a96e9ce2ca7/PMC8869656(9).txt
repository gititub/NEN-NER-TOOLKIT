Although changes in gut microbiota are temporary, diet can induce a shift in the gut microbiota. Numerous studies have pointed to a direct correlation between short-term dietary changes as well as long-term dietary changes with gut microbiome diversity in mouse models. In addition, it was found that gut microbiota participates in drug metabolism by producing specific enzymes, such as reductase and hydrolytic enzymes, thus affecting the efficacy, toxicity, and bioavailability of drugs. Various antibiotics also alter the diversity and composition of gut microbiota which leads to dysbiosis, and it was found to be linked with progression of various neurodegenerative as well as metabolic disorders.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29521, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been found as a major culprit in initiation as well as progression of various metabolic syndromes including diabetes mellitus, which unlocks various therapeutic interventions for the prevention as well as treatment of metabolic syndrome.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29788, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Isoflavone (genistein) reduced fasting glucose and insulin, as well as HOMA-IR, fibrinogen, and homocysteine levels. However, the current study's findings must be seen in the context of a healthy, well-balanced diet, which is likely to have boosted the positive benefits of genistein aglycone in our postmenopausal women. Isoflavones have been shown to have anti-diabetic benefits due to their a-glucosidase inhibitory activity. It is thought that genistein prevents diabetes by preserving insulin-positive beta-cells and altering the hepatic glucose metabolic enzyme profile. Genistein may prevent glucose-induced lipid peroxidation, modify cell islet pancreatic function, and increase basal metabolic rate and energy metabolism. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that genistein can serve as an estrogen agonist, resulting in the growth of estrogen-dependent human breast cancer tumors, and that long-term treatment with soy phytoestrogens has been linked to an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30800, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "7.

Studies have shown the close relationship between metabolic disease and NASH. People having NASH are more insulin resistant than healthy people, irrespective of their weight. Although most of the patients with NASH are insulin resistant, they do not show hyperglycemia because of decreased ability of the liver to clear insulin. NASH patients only develop diabetes when pancreatic beta cells are unable to increase insulin secretion to match the insulin resistance.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 31460, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Some of the diabetic medications are used for the management and treatment of NASH. Glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors, which are used as second-line therapy for diabetes, have been used for amelioration of insulin resistance in NASH patients which ultimately improves the hepatic condition. The possible mechanism behind the improvement in insulin resistance is changes in body weight. However, researchers are still exploring the exact mechanism of these drugs. Dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors are another diabetic lowering class of agents that can be used for the treatment of NASH. Although these agents are not potent glucose-lowering agents due to their oral intake and low safety, these are used in combination with metformin in the management of diabetes. However, strong evidence is still missing for the clinical use of these agents for the management of NASH. Pioglitazone, an anti-diabetic drug, has been shown to improve the condition in 60% of NASH patients. SGLT2 can be used for the treatment of NASH as it is helpful in glucose homeostasis. It has been shown to reverse liver steatosis and hepatocytes necrosis. These agents have been shown to decrease the plasma aminotransferases resulting in weight reduction which ultimately improves liver steatosis. One of these agents has been found to improve beta cell functions and insulin metabolism. Insulin has been under research for the treatment of liver steatosis and improvement in NASH.
