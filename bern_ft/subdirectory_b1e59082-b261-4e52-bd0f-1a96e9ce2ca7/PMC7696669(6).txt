Additionally, we received a batch from one of the manufacturers sampled before the blistering process (bulk batch); we have assayed the NDMA concentration in this batch, and it was above the recommended limit of 0.032 ppm. Therefore, we conclude that increased temperature present during the blistering process is not responsible for the NDMA formation.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 19228, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "4.
