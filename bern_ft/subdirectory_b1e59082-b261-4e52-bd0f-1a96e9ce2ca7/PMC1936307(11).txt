Risk minimization is achieved by promoting informed benefit-risk decisions, ensuring that natalizumab is not prescribed to immunocompromised patients, and maintaining vigilance for PML and other adverse events. In the EU, prescribing will be limited to physicians experienced in the treatment of neurological diseases and with timely access to MRI, in facilities that are prepared to deal with any hypersensitivity reactions. Education directed to physicians will cover guidance on the appropriate patient population for treatment, algorithms for managing suspected cases of PML, and information on other risks.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 30730, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Upon reintroduction of natalizumab for clinical use in the US, Biogen Idec implemented a comprehensive risk management plan, which is called Tysabri Outreach: Unified Commitment to Health (TOUCH). The purpose of TOUCH is to minimize known risks to patients and to continually reassess risks based on new data. Natalizumab will be made available in North America only to healthcare professionals and patients who meet requirements for inclusion in the TOUCH program. These requirements were chosen to ensure that prescribers and patients understand the risks of treatment with natalizumab, including PML and other opportunistic infections, and take advantage of several unique features of natalizumab distribution and administration. The enrolled prescriber counsels the patient on the risks and benefits of natalizumab therapy before an initial prescription is written. Administration of natalizumab is restricted to infusion centers where the staff has been educated about risks and appropriate use. During monthly infusion visits, members of the medical staff have regular opportunities to inform patients about PML risk and to screen for early symptoms of PML. Prescribing guidelines also state than an MRI scan should be obtained prior to treatment to help differentiate future MS symptoms from PML. Patient and physician data, after signed approval, are entered into a database maintained by Biogen Idec. The inclusion of all healthcare providers and patients in TOUCH will provide data for further defining the safety profile of natalizumab.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 32278, "infons": {"section_type": "METHODS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In addition, the safety of natalizumab is being further assessed in a 5000-patient registry cohort (the Tysabri Global Observation Program in Safety [TYGRIS] study) in the EU and North America, with 5-year follow-up for infections requiring hospitalization, cases of PML, malignancies, and all adverse events which are serious or medically significant. This study has an estimated 95% probability of detecting adverse events that occur at a frequency of at least 1 in 1500 patients.

In addition, patient acceptance should be positively impacted by the convenience of dosing and long-term tolerability. These characteristics make natalizumab an important new therapeutic option for patients with relapsing MS. The efficacy and safety of natalizumab are supported by evidence from multiple, randomized, controlled clinical trials. A rapid and sustained treatment effect was observed in a large Phase 2 trial in patients with relapsing MS, in which natalizumab reduced relapses by 50% and the formation of Gd+ MRI lesions by approximately 90%, compared with placebo.
