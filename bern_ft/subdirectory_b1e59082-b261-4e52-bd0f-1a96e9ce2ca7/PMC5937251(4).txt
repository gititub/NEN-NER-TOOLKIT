", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 9484, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The 3 main mechanisms by which natalizumab predisposes patients to PML have been described. First, natalizumab has an effect on the T cells which react against the active and dormant JCV. The JCV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes are critical for containing PML. These cells are most likely important not only in the brain but also in other sites such as bone marrow and spleen. It is anticipated that administration of natalizumab may prevent the entry of these cytotoxic T cells into the brain tissue or other sites where JCV may be dormant, preventing JCV suppression. Second, alpha4beta1 VCAM mediates the homing and retention of lymphocytes in the bone marrow and spleen. Blocking alpha4beta1 integrin could result in a release of B cells from the bone marrow and spleen, which are the common sites of JCV latency. Coupled with diminished immunosurveillance for JCV at these sites, this might increase the load of JCV in the peripheral blood. Peripheral blood, supporting the premise that B cells are mobilized by natalizumab and reports of increased numbers of circulating lymphocytes following the administration of natalizumab. Another aspect of natalizumab therapy-induced PML is that all previous reports of PML after natalizumab therapy involved patients who had undergone concurrent treatment with either interferon betaor other immunosuppressive agents suggesting that a suppressed immune state is needed for the development of PML in patients treated with natalizumab. According to Gorelik et al, the development of PML in patients on natalizumab is an interplay of 3 factors including duration of natalizumab treatment, the presence of anti-JCV antibodies, and concomitant use of other immunosuppressants. The highest risk was observed in patients treated with natalizumab for more than 24 months, positive for anti-JCV antibodies, and concurrent use of immunosuppressive agents.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 11378, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Since anti-JCV antibodies have been implicated as a factor in the development of PML in patients on natalizumab, further research is being done to develop an assay to help reduce PML infections in these patients. Currently, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based test that allows for the detection of anti-JCV antibodies, indicating past infection, has been developed and is offered for patient groups who have risk factors for PML such as treatment with natalizumab and rituximab and developing central nervous system (CNS) symptoms or have a history of hematological malignancy. However, it cannot distinguish between antibody against wild-type and mutated viruses and is still being investigated at this time. Other methods to detect JCV infection may not be sufficient because of poor sensitivity (assays for JCV DNA in blood) or only intermittent presence of virus in urine (assays for viral DNA in urine). Urine viral DNA test is being tested to stratify the risk for the development of PML in patients on natalizumab. Currently, there are no guidelines or recommendations about testing for PML prior to treating with natalizumab in the United States.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 12542, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "title_2"}, "text": "Rituximab", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 12552, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Rituximab is an agent that is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), rheumatoid arthritis with methotrexate, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and microscopic polyangiitis in combination with glucocorticoids.
