Worldwide post-marketing data from 23 November 2004 to 31 March 2013 comprised 279,196 patient-years of natalizumab exposure. Overall, 115,400 patients were treated in this period: 83,000 patients for at least 12 months, 59,100 for at least 24 months, 41,100 for at least 36 months and 26,600 for at least 48 months. As of 6 May 2013, 359 confirmed cases of PML had occurred, giving an overall post-marketing rate of 3.04 (95% CI 2.74-3.38) per 1000. The rate increases with number of natalizumab infusions, from 0.05/1000 with 1-12 infusions to >2/1000 after 36 infusions, with a tripling of risk at around 24 infusions (Figure 1). Of the 359 cases, 123 were from the US, 212 from Europe and 24 from the rest of the world; 83 (23%) patients died and 276 (77%) were still alive as of 6 May 2013.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 14304, "infons": {"file": "1471-2377-14-27-1.jpg", "id": "F1", "section_type": "FIG", "type": "fig_caption"}, "text": "Natalizumab PML risk estimates by treatment epoch.

Preliminary data suggest that 2-3% of patients seroconvert annually (i.e. change from anti-JCV antibody negative status to positive status and remain positive over time). Of the confirmed PML cases, 139 had pre-PML samples available for anti-JCV antibody testing and 138 of these tested positive prior to diagnosis of PML (6-187 months).
