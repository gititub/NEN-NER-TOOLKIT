In a Phase 3 trial, 2 years of natalizumab monotherapy reduced the mean annualized relapse rate (ARR) by 68% compared with placebo (p < 0.001) and the risk of sustained disability progression was reduced by 42% in the natalizumab group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.43-0.77; p < 0.001). Natalizumab decreased the mean number of new or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions by 83% over 2 years and the mean number of Gd+ lesions by 92% at 2 years (both p < 0.001). In another Phase 3 trial, natalizumab with interferon (IFN) beta-1a reduced the mean ARR by 55% at 2 years compared with IFNbeta-1a alone (p < 0.001) and risk of sustained disability progression was reduced by 24% (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.61-0.96; p = 0.02). Six percent of patients developed persistent antinatalizumab antibodies with loss of efficacy. The risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is been estimated at 1:1000 over 18 months; the longer term risk for PML is uncertain. The benefits and risks of natalizumab support its use as monotherapy for RRMS with high disease activity despite treatment with IFNbeta, and for patients with rapidly evolving severe RRMS.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1422, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "title_1"}, "text": "Introduction", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 1435, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disabling autoimmune neurological disease affecting approximately 2.5 million people worldwide. The initial presentation in most patients (85%) is relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) with relapses and remissions due to self-limiting plaques of inflammatory demyelination disseminated in time and place in the central nervous system (CNS). Subsequently, chronic noninflammatory loss of CNS axons gives rise to progressive disability (secondary progressive MS [SPMS]). Approximately 10%-15% of MS patients have progressive disability from the outset (primary progressive MS [PPMS]).. Clinical relapses in MS are due to acute inflammatory CNS demyelinating lesions causing white matter plaques. After a variable period (usually 10-15 years) of recurrent relapses with accumulating residual disability, the patient enters a course of inexorable slowly progressive disability (SPMS) due to secondary axonal degeneration. The pathogenesis is best understood as a complex interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental stimuli. Autoimmune reaction against different components of the CNS, particularly myelin structures, is thought to play an important role in the initiation of the inflammatory process. The transmigration of cells into the target tissue is regulated by chemotactic cytokines and adhesion molecule expression at the blood-brain barrier. The primary goals of MS therapy are to reduce relapses, reduce accumulating residual disability, and to prevent or delay the onset of progressive disability. Although the cause of MS is unknown, effective therapies are aimed at reducing the inflammatory disease process; natalizumab is the first targeted therapy which blocks an essential mechanism for lymphocyte entry to the CNS and thus prevents acute demyelinating relapses.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 3261, "infons": {"section_type": "INTRO", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "While some treatments for MS provide only symptom relief, disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are administered with the goal of altering the course of the disease.
