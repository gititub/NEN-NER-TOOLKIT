The drug has also been used in non-FDA-approved treatment of immune thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemias, other autoimmune disorders, and Epstein-Barr virus reactivation. Rituximab treatment has been associated with viral infectious complications. In February 2006, 9 years after the drug received its initial FDA approval, the labeling for rituximab was changed to include information about patients with NHL who had developed serious viral infections after treatment with the drug. Infections included hepatitis B, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, West Nile virus, and JCV. The pathophysiology of rituximab-associated PML is unclear. The mechanism underlying viral reactivation after rituximab treatment is hypothesized to be more complex than simple B-cell depletion. Stasi et al demonstrated changes in T-lymphocyte cytokine profiles among patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura who responded to rituximab, suggesting that changes in T-lymphocyte activity after B-lymphocyte depletion frequently occur. A role of B lymphocytes in JCV immune responses is supported by JCV reactivation and development of PML in patients with congenital disorders of humoral immunity. Experimental studies also suggested that hematopoietic progenitor cells might be a site of viral latency. Three patients in a cohort study demonstrated JCV in paraffin-embedded bone marrow biopsy samples obtained years before rituximab administration. Hematopoietic progenitor cells mobilized into the peripheral blood during chemotherapy may have been infected with latent JCV and may have facilitated hematogeneous spread of JCV into the CNS. As seen in natalizumab, PML associated with rituximab is also more frequently seen in immunocompromised patients, which again suggests that patients at risk are those who have greater immunosuppression. Carson et al reviewed PML cases among patients treated with rituximab included in the FDA database, the manufacturer, physicians, and literature reviews between 1997 and 2008. Overall, 52 patients with LPD, 2 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, 1 patient with rheumatoid arthritis, 1 patient with an idiopathic autoimmune pancytopenia, and 1 patient with immune thrombocytopenia developed PML after treatment with rituximab and other agents. Median time to death after PML diagnosis was 2.0 months.

A review of literature suggested 2 possible rituximab-associated PML syndromes. The first one is associated with short interval between last rituximab dose and PML diagnosis among patients with low CD4+ lymphocyte counts and occasionally low immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels. The second syndrome is associated with longer interval between the last rituximab dose and PML diagnosis among patients with higher CD4+ lymphocyte counts. At this time, there are no recommendations to screen patients for JCV prior to administration of rituximab and there is no evidence that either type of rituximab-associated PML syndrome can be prevented with currently available therapeutic measures.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 16192, "infons": {"section_type": "RESULTS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "The incidence of PML with natalizumab and rituximab in HIV-negative patients is 1 in 1000 and 1 in 32 000, respectively.
