The rarity and severity of the condition as well as the lack of a targeted antiviral against JCV translate into a lack of rigorous prospective studies for the treatment of natalizumab-associated PML. Though not prospectively studied, clinicians have employed plasma exchange (PLEX) in order to facilitate natalizumab clearance and to restore normal immunosurveillance of the brain previously impaired by natalizumab. However, there is a demonstrated risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after PLEX, which can cause further inflammatory brain damage. There are small case series showing the efficacy of maroviroc (a CCR5 antagonist) for the treatment of PML-IRIS. A more detailed discussion regarding the approach to treatment of natalizumab-associated PML is beyond the scope of this review but is available elsewhere.", "sentences": [], "annotations": [], "relations": []}, {"offset": 29662, "infons": {"section_type": "DISCUSS", "type": "paragraph"}, "text": "In order to remain vigilant about the risk for PML in natalizumab-treated MS patients, the drug is now administered through a risk mitigation program.

Fatigue and allergic reaction occurred more commonly in natalizumab-treated patients compared with placebo (P=0.048 and P=0.012, respectively). In the AFFIRM trial, serious adverse events occurred in 19% of patients treated with natalizumab and in 24% of patients receiving placebo (P=0.06). These events included MS clinical relapse (6% with natalizumab and 13% with placebo), cholelithiasis (<1% with both natalizumab and placebo), and the need for rehabilitation therapy (<1% with both natalizumab and placebo). There were two deaths in the AFFIRM study, both of which were in the natalizumab group and were attributed to melanoma and alcohol intoxication. Two deaths in the SENTINEL trial both occurred in the placebo group. Infections seen in both groups were generally mild to moderate in severity and were most commonly nasopharyngitis, influenza, upper respiratory tract viral infection, and pharyngitis. Serious infections in AFFIRM were recorded in 3.2% of patients in the natalizumab group and 2.6% of the placebo-treated group, which did not reach the level of statistical significance. In the SENTINEL study, there was no significant difference between the rate of infections and infusion reactions between the two groups.

In MS clinical trials, infusion reactions were seen in ~24% of natalizumab-treated patients compared with 18% of placebo-treated patients. The most common infusion-related symptoms in natalizumab-treated MS patients were headache, dizziness, fatigue, urticaria, pruritis, and rigors. Approximately 2% of natalizumab-treated MS patients experienced acute urticaria and other hypersensitivity reactions were seen in 1% of these patients. In the AFFIRM trial, 25 patients receiving natalizumab had 27 hypersensitivity reactions, five of which included anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions.
