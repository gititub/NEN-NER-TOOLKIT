One reason may be because rituximab redistributes CD20 into detergent-resistant lipid rafts. This clustering promotes association with other complexes such as the B-cell receptor, and binding to C1q, resulting in potent complement-dependent cytotoxicity, and it binds to all available CD 20 sites. In contrast, the newer agents trigger potent homotypic adhesion and lysosomal cell death and they bind to only a half of all the available CD20 sites. The immunosuppression caused by rituximab is thought to be greater than of obinutuzumab and ofatumumab which is likely why there are increased risk of PML in patients with rituximab.

The FDA-approved uses of JAK inhibitors currently are limited to primary polycythemia vera and primary myelofibrosis. They are being studied in other myeloproliferative disorders and other hematological malignancies. The mechanism by which these medications may cause reactivation of PML is due to the fact that the JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway have a very important role in host defense and autoimmunity. The JAK mutations are associated with primary immunodeficiency and complete STAT-1 deficiency, block interferon signaling, and can lead to lethal viral and bacterial infection including PML.
