Thestructuralconstraintsimposedby‘classical’drug
development will no longer be a limitation, marking the
end of the so called ‘druggable genome’ ( 30). With this, a
new type of therapy, based on disease mechanisms is start-
ing to emerge ( 31). The precise knowledge of the molecu-
lar processes underlying disease pathophysiology will be-come the new limiting step in drug development. In or-
der to elucidate these mechanisms, integrative approaches
that aggregate all the available information on the genet-ics basis of diseases are an essential step. Currently, some
of the more popular resources only represent a fraction of
the available knowledge. For example, OMIM ( 32)c o v e r s
only Mendelian diseases, Orphanet ( 6) is a compilation of
rarediseases,whiletheGWASCatalog( 7)isarepositoryfor
GWAS data, involving mainly complex diseases and traits(Foradetailedlistofavailableresources,seeSupplementary
TableS1).Conversely,DisGeNETaimsatintegratinginfor-
mation on the genetic underpinnings of all disease thera-peutic areas, and in such endeavor, at being a repository of
referenceforclosing thegenotype–phenotype gap.
DisGeNET platform has been used to study a variety
of biomedical problems, which include investigating the
molecularbasisofspecificdiseases( 33–36),annotatinglists
ofgenesproducedbydifferenttypesof omicsandsequenc-
ing protocols ( 37–39), validating disease genes prediction
methods( 40–42),understandingdiseasemechanismsinthe
context of protein networks ( 43,44), gaining insight into
drug action ( 45) and drug adverse reactions mechanisms
(46), drug repurposing ( 47), exploring the molecular ba-sis of disease comorbidities ( 48,49), assessing the perfor-
mance of text-mining algorithms ( 50) and as part of other
resources ( 51–53).
DisGeNET is a well-established resource with four sta-
ble releases (as of October, 2016). It is regularly growing,
fuelled and kept up-to-date by the new research, by the in-
corporation of new data sources, and by the interest of agrowing community of users. The careful use of standards,
andstateoftheartbiomedicalontologies,theattentionpaid
to keeping track of the provenance of the information, to-gether with the extensive documentation of the data pro-
cessingandthemultipleaccesspoints,makesofDisGeNET
aplatform ofchoice tosupport translational research.
