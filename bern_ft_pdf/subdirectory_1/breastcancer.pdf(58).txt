Whether the analysis of circulating tumor cells 
(CTCs) or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) will become 
a superior technical approach to detect ESR1 mutations, 
and monitor treatment response or progression is still 
being evaluated. Shaw el al
32 compared paired CTCs and 
ctDNA samples from the same patient cohort. More mu -
tations were discovered in ctDNA than the paired CTC 
sample, and not all CTCs had the same mutations that 
were found in the ctDNA. This finding suggests that 
ctDNA analyses may be more sensitive for tracking gene 
mutations rather than CTCs. However, there is a need to 
evaluate mutations in liquid biopsies to those found in distant metastatic tumors biopsies to draw definitive con -
clusions about discordances. Thus, digital PCR using liq -
uid biopsies has been applied to evaluate ESR1 mutation 
frequencies in several large phase 2/3 clinical trials such 
as BOLERO 2, SoFEA, PALOMA3, and FERGI.

With increasing use, the potential advantages of ctDNA 
versus CTC sampling should become apparent.
In the BOLERO-2 clinical trial, MBC patients 
who had prior exposure to a nonsteroidal AI were ran -
domized to the steroidal AI exemestane, or in combina -
tion with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus.33 Y537S and 
D538G ESR1 mutations were found in 29% (156/541) 
of patients.10 Thirty patients exhibited polyclonal 
Y537S and D538G mutations, and other studies have 
also confirmed that ESR1 mutations are frequently polyclonal.
9,28,34-37 Survival analyses showed that pa -
tients with Y537S or D538G mutations exhibited worse 
overall survival compared with patients who had only 
WT ER (32.1 vs 20.7 months). Patients with polyclonal

Cancer   November 1, 2019ESR1 mutations also exhibited a worse overall survival 
(15.2 months). Treatment with everolimus was associ -
ated with improved PFS for patients with the D538G 
mutation that was similar to WT (5.78 months for 
D538G, 8.48 months for WT), but the analysis of PFS 
in patients with the Y537S mutation was underpow -
ered to determine whether clinical benefit was achieved in this treatment arm. A potential limitation of this study was that only 2 ESR1 mutations were assessed using ddPCR, and the acquisition of other polyclonal 
ESR1 mutations may have impacted the prognostic re -
sults obtained in this trial.
Fribbens et al
9 developed a multiplex ddPCR assay 
to simultaneously study 7 ESR1 mutations in ctDNA from the SoFEA and PALOMA3 clinical trials. In the 
SoFEA clinical trial, patients who exhibited prior sen -
sitivity to nonsteroidal AIs were randomized to receive fulvestrant plus anastrozole, fulvestrant plus placebo, or the steroidal AI exemestane.
38 In this cohort of patients,  
ESR1 mutations were found in 39.1% (63/161) of patient’s  
ctDNA, and 49.1% (27/55) of these patients exhibited polyclonal mutations. Patients who had an ESR1 muta -
tion and were treated with exemestane had worse PFS compared with patients who did not have detectable ESR1 mutations (2.6 vs 8.0 months). Patients who were 
treated with fulvestrant derived significant clinical bene -
fit regardless of whether they had detectable ESR1 muta -
tions (PFS 5.7 months for ESR1 mutations, 5.4 months 
for WT ER). Therefore, this study suggests that patients 
with ESR1 mutations were relatively sensitive to a ful -
vestrant-containing regiment and should be treated with 
fulvestrant if there were detectable ESR1 mutations.
In the PALOMA-3 clinical trial, patients who pro -
gressed during ET were randomized to receive fulves -
trant or fulvestrant plus palbociclib.
5 ESR1 mutations 
were detected in 25.3% (91/360) of the patients in this 
cohort. Patients with ESR1 mutations had improved  
PFS when treated with fulvestrant plus palbociclib ver -
sus fulvestrant monotherapy (9.4 vs 3.6 months), as well as patients with WT ESR1 (9.5 vs 5.4 months). These 
results suggest that patients who have progressed on a 
nonsteroidal AI derive clinical benefit from fulvestrant 
and palbociclib, regardless of whether the patient ctDNA exhibited ESR1 mutations. However, a more recent anal -
ysis of the PALOMA-3 clinical trial demonstrated that although there was no overall enrichment of ESR1 mu -
tations during treatment, the Y537S mutation was sele -
ctively enriched in fulvestrant-based treatments in the metastatic setting, suggesting relative resistance to ful -
vestrant and palbociclib.
