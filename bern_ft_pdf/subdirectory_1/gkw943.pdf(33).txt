A COMPREHENSIVE CENTRALIZED REPOSITORY
OF DISEASE-ASSOCIATED GENES AND VARIANTS
In order to present the most complete landscape of the ex-
tent of our knowledge of the genetic underpinnings of hu-
man diseases, DisGeNET integrates data from expert cu-
rated databases with information gathered through text-mining the scientific literature. The DisGeNET release 4.0
includes the following resources (for more details about
the data processing, and versions, please check the Sup-plementary Data and http://disgenet.org/web/DisGeNET/
menu/dbinfo ):
- The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) that
providesinformationaboutchemicalsandgenes,andtheir
effectin human health and disease ( 3)
- UniProt, a repository centred on protein sequence and
function, that also include disease annotations from
OMIM, and from expert curation of the scientific litera-
ture(4)
-ClinVar*,apublicarchiveofrelationshipsbetweenhuman
variants and phenotypes,includingdiseases ( 5)
-Orphanet*, a portal on rare diseases and theirgenes ( 6)
- The GWAS Catalog*, a curated collection of published
GWAS results( 7)
- The Rat Genome Database (RGD), a repository for the
genetic, genomic and phenotypic data of the laboratory
rat (8)
-TheMouseGenomeDatabase(MGD),themaincommu-
nity resource for the laboratory mouse, that includes in-
formation about mouse models ofdisease ( 9)
- The Genetic Association Database (GAD), an archive of
genetic association studies ( 10)
Additionally,DisGeNETincludestwodatasetsobtained
using differenttext-miningapproaches
- The Literature Human Gene Derived Network
(LHGDN), a data set of gene-disease associations
obtained by text-mining the Entrez Gene Reference Into
Function(GeneRIFs)usingaConditionalRandomField
approach ( 11)- BeFree data, obtained using the BeFree System, which
extracts gene-disease associations from MEDLINE ab-
stracts(12,13)
*Newsources withrespecttothelast published release
The data in DisGeNET are aggregated according to the
original source in: CURATED , that includes data from
UniProt,ClinVar,Orphanet,theGWASCatalogandCTD
(human data), PREDICTED , including RGD, MGD and
CTD (mouse and rat data), and ALL. For further details

DisGeNET 4.0 (June, 2016) contains 429 036 gene-
diseaseassociations(GDAs),linking17381genesto15093diseases,disordersandclinicalorabnormalhumanpheno-
types. Ninety nine percent of the GDAs in DisGeNET are
supported by at least one publication, and the informationcontainedinDisGeNETcorrespondstomorethan289000
publications. DisGeNET contains 72 870 variant-disease
associations (VDAs), between 46 589 SNPs and 6356 dis-eases and phenotypes. The GDAs provided by the expert
curated resources (DisGeNET curated) represent only the
2%ofalltheinformation(SupplementaryFigureS1,panelA), highlighting the need of text-mining algorithms to un-
lock the information available as free text in scientific pub-
lications. The data obtained from each resource are ratherunique, as evidenced by the small overlap between sources
(Supplementary Figure S1, panel B). The lack of redun-
dancyacrossdifferentresourcesemphasizestheimportance
of integration, and is a consequence of the fragmented na-
tureofdataproduction,thedifferentfocusofindividualre-
sourcesand thedifferentcriteriaforcuration.
