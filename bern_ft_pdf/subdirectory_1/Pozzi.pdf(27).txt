Essentials
Prothrombin converts slowly to thrombin upon interac-
tion with histone H4.
Histone H4 may also affect the reactivity of prothrom-
bin toward factor Xa.
Histone H4 enhances or inhibits activation by factor Xa
depending on cofactor Va.
The results reveal an unanticipated dual effect of
histone H4 on prothrombin activation by factor Xa.
Summary. Background: Recent studies have documented
the ability of prothrombin to convert to the mature pro-
tease thrombin upon interaction with histone H4. Theeffect is abrogated by mutation of the catalytic Ser andrequires the Gla domain. Objectives: To explore the effect
of histone H4 on the reactivity of prothrombin to itsphysiological activator factor (F) Xa, free or assembled inthe prothrombinase complex. Methods: The effect of
histone H4 on prothrombin activation by FXa and
prothrombinase is studied with kinetic assays. The poten-
tial epitope of prothrombin recognizing histone H4 isexplored with electrostatic calculations using recentcrystal structures. Results and Conclusions: Binding of
histone H4 has a dual effect on prothrombin activationby FXa that is of mechanistic signiﬁcance: it enhances thereaction >10-fold in the absence of cofactor Va, but
produces complete inhibition in the presence of cofactor.
Histone H4 binding to prothrombin produces very slow
autoactivation independent of the coagulation cascadeand promotes slow thrombin generation by FXa in theabsence of phospholipids. In addition, histone H4 has arapid and drastic inhibitory effect on prothrombinactivation by prothrombinase that is likely to dominatepathophysiology.Keywords : blood coagulation factors; enzyme precursors;

Introduction
Prothrombin, or coagulation factor II, is a vitamin
K-dependent zymogen, 579 residues long, that circulatesin the blood at a high concentration (0.1 mg mL
/C01) and
long half-life (60 h) [1]. The protein has a modular
assembly comprising a Gla domain, two kringles and theprotease domain arranged spatially as two rigid ends (theN-terminal Gla domain/kringle-1 pair and C-terminalkringle-2/protease domain pair) connected by a ﬂexiblelinker between the two kringles [2,3]. In the penultimatestep of the coagulation cascade, prothrombin is efﬁcientlyconverted to the mature protease thrombin by the pro-
thrombinase complex composed of factor (F) Xa and
cofactor Va assembled on a membrane surface in thepresence of Ca
2+[4]. The conversion involves sequential
cleavage at R271 and R320 along two alternative path-ways that lead to generation of the inactive intermediateprethrombin-2 (cleavage at R271 ﬁrst) or the active inter-mediate meizothrombin (cleavage at R320 ﬁrst). Becauseneither intermediate accumulates, knowledge of which
pathway of activation predominates under speciﬁc
conditions may be irrelevant to physiology but carriesmechanistic signiﬁcance. The recent observation that pro-thrombin can convert to thrombin by autoactivationupon mutations around the site of cleavage at R320 [5]has mechanistic and translational relevance [6]. Autoacti-vation is initiated by prothrombin itself and is abrogatedby mutation of the catalytic Ser. In addition, wild-type
prothrombin autoactivates to thrombin upon binding of
histone H4 to the Gla domain [7], revealing unexpectednew properties of the zymogen worthy of further investi-gation.
The observation of a crosstalk between prothrombin
and histone H4 should be considered in the context ofthe emerging ﬁeld of immunothrombosis [8], an innateimmune response that links coagulation to the recogni-
tion, containment and destruction of microbial pathogens.
Indeed, histone H4 is one of numerous modulatorsreleased into the extracellular media during response totraumatic injury, sepsis, inﬂammation and cell necrosis
