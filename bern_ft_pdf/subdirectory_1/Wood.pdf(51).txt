 Experimental conditions were as
follows: 5 m
MTris, 0.1% PEG-8000 and 145 m MNaCl (pH 7.4) at
37°C.

those reported for WE produced in mammalian BHKcells from prethrombin-1 and activated with prothrombin-ase [6], or produced in E. coli from prethrombin-2 and
activated with ecarin [4,16]. Hence, differences in glyco-sylation and the introduction of three additional muta-tions in the activation domain of WEDGE relative toWE are inconsequential with regard to the kinetics of
substrate hydrolysis.
The pharmacodynamic efﬁcacy of WEDGE was tested
in non-human primates by analysis of the APTT inplasma. Bolus administration of WEDGE caused prolon-gation of the APTT (Fig. 2), with the greatest effectoccurring at 15 min post-injection, and with a return tobaseline by 120 min. WEDGE prolonged the APTTapproximately 1.6-fold at 2.5 lgk g
/C01and 1.3-fold at
1.0lgk g/C01after 15 min, consistent with the dose-depen-
dent increase in the APTT reported previously for WE[10]. There were no WEDGE-related adverse events in thestudy subjects over the time scale of the experiments.Bleeding times measured at 15 min (3.3 min), 30 min(2.8 min) and 60 min (2.2 min) post-injection were notsigniﬁcantly elevated over baseline (2.5 min).
The development of an efﬁcient strategy for the produc-
tion of thrombin from its inactive precursors by autoactiva-
tion suggests other applications. The structurally relatedzymogen protein C has been extensively studied as an anti-coagulant and anti-inﬂammatory agent [17 –19]. The pro-
duction of activated protein C requires thrombin, whichmust be added to the preparation and then eliminated toavoid potential thrombotic complications. The structural
analogy of the activation domain of protein C withprethrombin-2 supports the viability of autoactivation forthis natural anticoagulant factor [20] and its large-scaleproduction devoid of external enzymes. In general, the acti-vation sequence of a trypsin-like protease may be re-engi-neered to promote autoactivation for the production of
mature proteases of clinical and biotechnological rele-
vance.

Time (min)APTT (s)
Fig. 2. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) values as a
function of time following a single bolus injection of WEDGE at
1.0lgk g/C01(open red circles) and 2.5 lgk g/C01(closed red circles), or
2.5lgk g/C01in a second baboon (closed green circles). WEDGE
causes the APTT to increase signiﬁcantly and transiently in a dose-
dependent manner that reproduces the effect previously reported for
W215A/E217A (WE) [9,10].
