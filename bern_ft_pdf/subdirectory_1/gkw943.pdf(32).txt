ABSTRACT
The information about the genetic basis of human
diseases lies at the heart of precision medicine and
drug discovery. However, to realize its full poten-
tial to support these goals, several problems, such
as fragmentation, heterogeneity, availability and dif-ferent conceptualization of the data must be over-
come. To provide the community with a resource
free of these hurdles, we have developed DisGeNET(http://www.disgenet.org ), one of the largest avail-
able collections of genes and variants involved in
human diseases. DisGeNET integrates data from ex-pert curated repositories, GWAS catalogues, animal
models and the scientiﬁc literature. DisGeNET data
are homogeneously annotated with controlled vo-cabularies and community-driven ontologies. Addi-
tionally, several original metrics are provided to as-
sist the prioritization of genotype–phenotype rela-tionships. The information is accessible through a
web interface, a Cytoscape App, an RDF SPARQL
endpoint, scripts in several programming languagesand an R package. DisGeNET is a versatile platform
that can be used for different research purposes in-
cluding the investigation of the molecular underpin-
nings of speciﬁc human diseases and their comor-
bidities, the analysis of the properties of diseasegenes, the generation of hypothesis on drug thera-
peutic action and drug adverse effects, the validation
of computationally predicted disease genes and theevaluation of text-mining methods performance.INTRODUCTION
Research on the genetic causes of disease has accelerated
as a result of both the completion of the human genome
and the development of the Next Generation Sequencingtechniques, which has opened the promise of translating
the alterations in individuals’ genomes in clinically rele-
vantinformationtoassistdiseasediagnosticsandtherapeu-tic decision-making. These efforts have generated a large
volume of potentially useful information that has boosted
biomedical research. Navigating and analyzing this infor-mation, however, is still cumbersome and time-consuming
for researchers, due to four main hurdles. First, relevant
information about the genetic causes of disease is scat-tered across specialized catalogues focused on specific dis-
ease classifications (i.e. Mendelian, or rare diseases), dif-
ferent model organisms, or on particular technological ap-proaches (such as GWAS). Second, the fragmented nature
of the processes generating this information has resulted in
data of heterogeneous nature, not always annotated withcontrolled vocabularies and ontologies, and provided with
different formats which are often non-trivial to reconcile.
Third, the identification and prioritization of the relevantinformation from the vast quantity of data they harbor is
oftenachallengingtaskfortheenduser.Finally,theaccess
to most resources is usually limited to web interfaces and
