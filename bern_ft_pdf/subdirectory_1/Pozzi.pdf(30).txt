 Histone H4 carries anet positive charge and binds to prothrombin through anelectrostatically driven mechanism [7]. The crystal struc-
ture of prothrombin devoid of residues 146 –167 [3] reveals
a cluster of solvent-exposed acidic residues interspersedthrough hydrophobic residues in the Gla domain and adja-cent kringle-1 (Fig. 2). The locale is associated with anarea of strong and negative electrostatic potential that mayhelp steer the positively charged histone H4 to its site anddirectly compete for cofactor Va binding. Interestingly, thenaturally occurring mutations Y44C [20,21] and D118Y
[22] affect this region of prothrombin and their bleeding
phenotype may be explained by a weakened binding ofcofactor Va. Alternatively, the epitope of prothrombin rec-ognizing histone H4 may change upon binding to pro-thrombinase and the inhibitory effect on prothrombinasemay originate from interference with FXa, rather than, orin addition to, cofactor Va. Furthermore, conformational
transitions induced by histone H4 binding may have long-range effects on kringles and the protease domain, therebydisrupting interactions with prothrombinase at multiplesites beyond the Gla domain. A rigorous dissection of themolecular origin of the intriguing effect of histone H4 on
prothrombin will therefore require extensive mutagenesis
and functional and structural analysis using the strategydeveloped recently for the study of this zymogen [17]. Thetranslational appeal of such an analysis should also beemphasized. Identiﬁcation of the locale for histone H4binding to prothrombin may point to new targets of thera-peutic intervention where the activity of prothrombinase isinhibited through interference with prothrombin rather
than with the enzyme FXa or cofactor Va.

Fig. 2. Regions of prothrombin for potential interaction with histone H4. The crystal structure of prothrombin devoid of residues 146 –167 in
the linker connecting the two kringles [3] reveals the general assembly of the modular components of the zymogen (GD, Gla domain;K1, kringle-1; K2, kringle-2; Ac, A chain; Bc, B chain). The left panel shows acidic (red) and hydrophobic (gold) residues with solvent expo-
sure>70% in the Gla domain and adjacent kringle-1 that are prime candidates for mutagenesis screens aimed at identifying the epitope of
prothrombin recognizing histone H4. Two of these residues (Y44 and D118) are associated with naturally occurring mutations causing severebleeding [20 –22]. The panel at right shows the electrostatic potential surface (red, negative; blue, positive), contoured at /C62kT/eunder condi-
tions of 140 m
MNaCl, pH 7.4. The surface identiﬁes the Gla domain and neighbor kringle-1 as regions of charge complementarity to the posi-
tively charged histone H4.
