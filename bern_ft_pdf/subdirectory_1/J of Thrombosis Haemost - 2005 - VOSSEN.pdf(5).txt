year (95% CI 0.3–1.7).
A total of 134 thrombophilic individuals (23%) received
short-term prophylactic anticoagulation during one or morerisk situations: surgery ( n¼95), pregnancy ( n¼43; 13 during
puerperium only; range start treatment during pregnancy:weeks 5–36), plaster cast ( n¼13), traveling ( n¼9) and after
twisting a knee or an ankle ( n¼2). No venous events occurred
during any of these risk situations under short-term prophy-lactic anticoagulant treatment. Of the controls, 115 (10%) alsoreceived short-term anticoagulant treatment during risk situ-ations: during surgery ( n¼107), pregnancy ( n¼4; 3 during
puerperium only), plaster cast ( n¼12), traveling ( n¼1) and
after twisting a knee ( n¼1) or during chronic enteritis ( n¼1).
Discussion
We conducted a large prospective follow-up study in nine
centers in eight countries on 1626 probands and relatives, and1212 controls to obtain valid estimates of the risk of venousthrombosis in families with inherited thrombophilia. In the
present report, we describe the risk of a ﬁrst venous throm-
boembolic event in 575 thrombophilic individuals and 1118control subjects who were followed-up to 7 years (mean follow-up 5.6 years) and who were asymptomatic and not on long-term anticoagulant treatment at study inclusion.
Among the thrombophilic individuals, the annual risk of
a ﬁrst DVT or PE was 0.8% per year. The incidence waslowest for thrombophilic individuals with factor V Leiden
(0.1% year
)1) and highest for thrombophilic subjects with
antithrombin deﬁciency (1.7% year)1), individuals with
combined defects (1.6% year)1) and men (1.4% year)1).
DVTs and PEs occurred spontaneously in 58% of thethrombophilic individuals and 43% of the controls. Theannual risk was not increased in thrombophilic individualswho encountered additional acquired risk situations (e.g.surgery, immobilization, pregnancy, plaster cast) during
which no short-term anticoagulation treatment was pre-
scribed.
