16This mutation, however,
did not increase the risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes de ﬁned by
2 or more miscarriages, fetal growth res triction, and/or intrauterine fetal
death.17PS-K196E mutation seems to be Japanese speci ﬁc, because the
mutation has not been observed in the white, Chinese, or Korean
populations.11,18,19

BLOOD, 5 NOVEMBER 2015 xVOLUME 126, NUMBER 19 2247Racial differences in the genetic background of venous thrombosis
have been well documented.20As an example, the factor V (FV) Leiden
mutation, R506Q, that is a VTE risk f actor is predominantly found in
white populations.21This mutation renders FVa resistant to the inac-
tivation by APC, resulting in a hypercoagulable state.22,23A mouse
model carrying the homologous murine FV Leiden mutation (R504Q)
showed enhanced venous thrombosis, consistent with an increased
incidence of VTE in human FV Leiden carriers.24,25Thus, FV Leiden
mice provide a valuable in vivo model of thrombosis-associated dis-
eases in whites and have been studied under various stimulations or
pathophysiologic conditions.25-27
Recent guidelines for establishing pathogenic causality of rare
genetic variants emphasize that the strongest evidence for causality
comes from disruption of the candidate gene in a model organism (eg,
a mouse) that recapitulates the pathology in humans.20Hence, we
generated a mouse colony carrying the PS-K196E mutation. Based on
PS-knockout (PS-KO) studies,3,28homozygous PS de ﬁciency in mice
leads to embryonic lethality with a fulminant coagulopathy and hem-
orrhages. Heterozygous PS-de ﬁcient mice had reduced plasma PS
antigen levels and APC cofactor activ ity, and they survived to adulthood
but showed severe thrombosis after induction of pulmonary embolism
(PE) by injection of tissue factor.
In the present study, we generated PS-K196E knockin mice and
analyzed their phenotypes, comparing with heterozygous PS-de ﬁcient
m i c ea n dF V - R 5 0 4 Qk n o c k - i nm i c e . Our data show that the PS-K196E
mutation in mice increases the risk o f thrombotic diseases, proving the
pathogenic causality of this mutation beyond doubt. The PS K196E
mice may be valuable for future pathogenic studies related to venous
thrombosis.
Materials and methods
Generation of PS-K196E knockin mice and PS-KO mice, genetic
analysis, and RNA analysis
The targeting vector was introduced into 129/SvEvTac-derived embryonic stem
cells by electroporation.29-32The male chimeras were bred to wild-type C57BL/6J
females and F1 offspring with the PS-K196E mutation or PS de ﬁciency were
backcrossed to C57BL/6J mice (Japan SLC, Hamamatsu, Japan) for 10 gener-
ations. The detailed materials and method s are described in the supplemental Data
(available on the Blood Web site). All animal procedures were approved by the
Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Cerebral and Cardiovascular
Center and performed in accordance with institutional and national guidelines
and regulations.
Plasma APC cofactor activity and PS antigen assays
Blood was collected from anesthetized mice via the retro-orbital plexus into tubes
containing a 0.1 volume of 3.8% sodium c itrate. Plasma was prepared from blood
by centrifugation at 1000 gfor 10 minutes.
Plasma APC cofactor activity was meas ured by an activated partial throm-
boplastin time (APTT)-based clotting assay using a recombinant mouse APC.33
Plasma samples (40 mL) were pretreated with 450 nM recombinant mouse APC
or Owren-Koller buffer (10 mL) for 1 min at 37°C. STA-Cephascreen reagent
(50mL; Diagnostica Stago, Asni `eres-sur-Seine, France) was added and incubated
for 3 min at 37°C. The clotting time was recorded using a coagulometer
(STart4; Diagnostica Stago) after adding 25 mM CaCl 2(50mL). The prolongation
of clotting time by the addi tion of APC to wild-type plasma was considered as
100% APC cofactor activity.
Plasma PS antigens were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
using antibodies against human PS. Plasma samples in 0.5% bovine serum al-
b u m i nw e r ea p p l i e dt or a b b i ta n t i –human PS-coated (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark)
microwell plates for 2 hours at room temperature. Bound PS was detected byincubation with peroxidase -conjugated rabbit anti-human PS prepared using
Peroxidase Labeling Kit-NH 2(Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) for 1 hour.
