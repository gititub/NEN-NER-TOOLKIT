 At study entry, 19 (10%) of the
protein C deﬁcient relatives, 43 (22%) of the protein S
deﬁciency relatives, 32 (22%) of the antithrombin deﬁcientrelatives, 11 (5%) of the relatives with factor V Leiden and22 (23%) of the relatives with combined defects received life-
long anticoagulation.
Thrombotic history
Probands Of all included probands, 532 (89%) had experi-
enced an objectively conﬁrmed venous thrombosis prior to
study entry (Table 2). The remaining 68 probands (11%) had
been identiﬁed because of superﬁcial thrombophlebitis ( n¼
58), or were the ﬁrst in the family in whom a defect wasdemonstrated with no personal but only a family history ofvenous thrombosis ( n¼10). Of all probands with a personal
history of thrombosis, 288 (54%) had experienced one or morerecurrencies before study entry. The mean age at the ﬁrstvenous thrombosis was 30 years (range 0–71) and ranged per
type of defect from 26 years in patients with antithrombin
deﬁciency to 33 years in patients with FV Leiden (Table 2). Ofall probands, 50% had experienced venous thrombosis beforethe age of 29 (Fig. 1). Spontaneous venous thrombotic events,i.e. venous events without known precipitating risk factors orduring use of oral contraceptives only, occurred in 220 of the362 (61%) probands for whom this information was available.Table 1 General characteristics of the probands, relatives and controls at

Relatives and controls Of all included relatives, 139 (16%)
had experienced an objectively conﬁrmed venous thrombosiscompared with 15 (1%) in the controls (Table 2) prior to studyentry. The percentage of relatives with a venous event varied
per type of defect from 6% in those with the FV Leiden
mutation to 29% in individuals with combined defects(Table 3). Recurrencies were present before baseline in 58(42%) relatives with a history of venous thrombosis, and in
only 2 (13%) of the controls with a history of venousthrombosis.
The mean age at the ﬁrst venous thrombosis before study
entry was 36 years (range 13–71) in the relatives and 41 years(range 24–68) in the controls (Table 2). Per type of defect, theage of onset ranged from 28 years in relatives with combined
defects to 42 years in relatives with protein C deﬁciency
(Table 2).
Spontaneous venous events occured before study entry in 54
of the 90 (60%) relatives and in 7 of the 14 (50%) controls forwhom this information was available, with thrombotic eventsoccuring during use of oral contraceptives considered asspontaneous events.
The incidence of venous events experienced before study
entry in relatives was 4.4 (95% CI 3.7–5.2) per 1000 person
years and in controls 0.3 (95% CI 0.2–0.5) per 1000 personyears (Table 3). Per type of thrombophilia, the incidencewas lowest in the relatives with the FV Leiden mutation (1.5per 1000 person years) and highest for those with combineddefects (8.4 per 1000 person years) (Table 3). The incidenceregarding FV Leiden did not change after exclusion ofhomozygous individuals. The incidence was higher in men
in the relatives (6.2 per 1000 person years for men and 3.
