 The pro-thrombotic effect due to autoactivation [7] is unlikely to
be of physiological signiﬁcance because it is too slow and
easily surpassed by thrombin activation along the intrinsicpathway of the coagulation cascade triggered by necrotictissue [11]. The procoagulant effect mediated by enhancedthrombin generation by FXa in the absence of phospho-lipids (Fig. 1A) is more rapid than autoactivation, butagain its physiological signiﬁcance diminishes when mem-brane surfaces are readily available for assembly of the
prothrombinase complex. In this case, the effect of his-
tone H4 turns into rapid and complete inhibition ofthrombin generation (Fig. 1G) and is likely to dominatethe pathophysiology. Indeed, addition of histone H4 tohuman plasma signiﬁcantly and progressively prolongsboth PT and APTT (data not shown). The recent sugges-tion of a prothrombotic effect of histones mediated by

needs re-evaluation in the context of our observations. Itis difﬁcult to envision a prothrombotic effect of histones,and certainly histone H4, that is mediated by inhibitionof the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex if thrombingeneration by the prothrombinase complex is completelyinhibited in the ﬁrst place. The dominant effect of histoneH4 on prothrombin activation is therefore inhibitory, at
least toward the major reaction driving thrombingeneration in the coagulation cascade. Further investiga-
tion is clearly needed to clarify the effect of histones on
prothrombin and other coagulation factors, which is morecomplex than currently assumed [11,16].
The interaction of histone H4 with prothrombin also
has substantial mechanistic signiﬁcance, especially in thecontext of recent crystallographic analysis [2,3,17]. Bindingof histone H4 to the Gla domain is required for autoacti-vation [7] and probably mediates the dual effect on FXa
activation reported here because of involvement of the

Fig. 1. Effect of histone H4 on prothrombin activation by factor Xa. Effect of histone H4 on the initial velocities of thrombin generation in
the absence (A) or presence (D) of phospholipids, and in the presence of cofactor Va and phospholipids (G). The fold change measures the
ratio between the initial velocity in the presence (v i) and the absence (v 0) of histone H4. The concentration of histone H4 producing half of the
maximal effect is (A) 0.9 /C60.2lM, (D) 1.0 /C60.2lMand (G) 3.5 /C60.5lM. The effect of histone H4 was also monitored by following the dis-
appearance of prothrombin over time using SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. In all assays, dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)
amide was added to inhibit thrombin and meizothrombin activity. Factor Xa cleaves prothrombin at R155, R271 and R320. Cleavage at
R155 generates prethrombin-1 (Pre-1) and fragment-1 (F1) composed of the Gla domain and kringle-1. Cleavage at R271 produces prethrom-bin-2 (Pre-2) and fragment 1.2 (F1.2) composed of the Gla domain and the two kringles, and additional cleavage of prethrombin-2 at R320generates the A and B chains. Direct cleavage of R320 generates the B chain and fragment 1.2.A (F1.2.A), where fragment 1.2 is attached to
the A chain. In the presence of 3 l
Mhistone H4, prothrombin activation by factor Xa is enhanced with (E, F) or without (B, C) phospholipids,
but is inhibited in the presence of cofactor Va and phospholipids (H, I). The inhibition completely abrogates thrombin generation at high con-centrations.

interaction changes the conformation of prothrombin andmakes R155 available for cleavage by FXa even in theabsence of phospholipids (Fig. 1c). The effect underscoresthe molecular plasticity of prothrombin revealed by recentcrystal structures and the important role of the linker con-
necting the two kringles, where R155 resides, in brokering
long-range communication within the zymogen [2,3,17].The inhibitory effect of histone H4 when prothrombin isbound to prothrombinase can be explained in terms of adirect antagonism of cofactor Va, whose epitope includesthe Gla domain of the zymogen [19].
