Summary. Background : Reliable risk estimates for venous
thrombosis in families with inherited thrombophilia are scarcebut necessary for determining optimal screening and treatment
policies. Objectives : In the present analysis, we determined the
risk of a ﬁrst venous thrombotic event in carriers of athrombophilic defect (i.e. antithrombin-, protein C- or proteinS deﬁciency, or factor V Leiden). Patients and methods :T h e
asymptomatic carriers had been tested prior to this study in nineEuropean thrombosis centers because of a symptomatic carrierin the family, and were followed prospectively for 5.7 years onaverage between March 1994 and January 2001. Annually, data
were recorded on the occurrence of risk situations for venous
thrombosis and events (e.g. venous thrombosis, death). Results :
Twenty-six of the 575 asymptomatic carriers (4.5%) and sevenof the 1118 controls (0.6%) experienced a ﬁrst deep venousthrombosis or pulmonary embolism during follow-up. Of theseevents, 58% occurred spontaneously in the carriers comparedwith 43% in the controls. The incidence of ﬁrst events was 0.8%per year (95% CI 0.5–1.2) in the carriers compared with 0.1%
per year (95% CI 0.0–0.2) in the controls. The highest incidencewas associated with antithrombin deﬁciency or combined
defects, and the lowest incidence with factor V Leiden.Conclusions : The incidence of venous events in asymptomatic
individuals from thrombophilic families does not exceed the riskof bleeding associated with long-term anticoagulant treatmentin the literature (1–3%).
Keywords : asymptomatic, inherited thrombophilia, venous
thrombosis.
Introduction
Venous thrombosis has an overall incidence of about 1–2 per
1000 individuals per year and is a serious disorder withpotential major complications such as death from pulmonaryembolism, recurrences and the development of a disabling post-thrombotic syndrome [1–3]. It has been postulated that not asingle risk factor, but interaction between multiple genetic and
environmental risk factors is a prerequisite for venous throm-
bosis to develop [4–6]. Currently, several genetic risk factors areknown to increase the risk of venous thrombosis: deﬁciencies inthe anticoagulation factors protein C, protein S and anti-thrombin, and the factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210Amutations [7–11]. In accordance w ith the multicausal nature of
thrombosis, it was found that the presence of a family historyof venous thrombosis increases the thrombotic risk in individ-
uals with protein C deﬁciency or factor V Leiden, due most
probably to the concomitant presence of other genetic orenvironmental risk factors within the family [6,12,13].
