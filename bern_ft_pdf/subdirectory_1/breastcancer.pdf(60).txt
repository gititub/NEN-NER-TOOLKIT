Current treatment guidelines for ER-positive MBC  
do not stratify patients based on ESR1 mutation status.  
Although many preclinical studies have demonstrated that ESR1 mutant cells respond to fulvestrant, but 
with less sensitivity, recent retrospective analyses of the PALOMA-2 clinical trial published by O’Leary et al
39  
trial showed that patients treated with fulvestrant mono -
therapy alone, or in combination with palbociclib con -
tinued to acquire the Y537S ESR1 mutation during treatment. Furthermore, a more recent retrospective TABLE 1.  ESR1  Mutation Frequency in Primary or Metastatic Tumors, or ctDNA

﻿ESR1  Mutution/DMnuto eu tl

Cancer   November 1, 2019correlative analysis of the PALMOA-3 trial evaluated 
whether early changes in ESR1 or PIK3CA  mutations 
measured using ddPCR of ctDNA were predictive of response to therapy. Although total ESR1 mutant abun -
dance was shown to decrease in both treatment arms, these changes were not predictive of response to fulves -
trant.
42 In contrast, PIK3CA  mutation frequency was 
lower in the fulvestrant and palbociclib-treated group 
and was significantly predictive of PFS. This study sug -
gests that truncal mutations, such as PIK3CA , may be 
more useful to predict treatment responses. Differences 
in the predictive value of these 2 genetic biomarkers may 
be due to the clinical resistance of selected ESR1 mutant 
cells to fulvestrant and the truncal nature of PIK3CA  
mutations that are shared by all subclones in the meta -
static tumor. O’Leary et al also showed that other driver 
mutations in RB1, growth factor receptors, TP53 , and 
PIK3CA  were acquired over the course of treatment. 
The acquisition of these mutations was associated with a longer time of treatment, and acquired mutations at 
the end of treatment correlated with a longer PFS. These 
data support the conclusion that driver mutations may be 
acquired later in therapy as a consequence of therapeutic 
pressures, but perhaps not always in the early treatment 
setting. These studies also suggest there may be limited 
clinical utility to stratify patients to treatment based on 
ESR1 mutation status alone and that concurrent acquisi -
tion of other driver mutations may play a significant role in therapeutic resistance.
There are several considerations for the development 
of new targeted agents that may prove effective in suppress -
ing ESR1 mutant-bearing tumors.
