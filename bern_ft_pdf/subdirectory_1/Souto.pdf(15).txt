 However, our heritability analyses pro-vided no evidence for such a depression in genetic signal,indicating that there must exist substantial overlap inthe genetic determinants of venous and arterial formsof thrombosis. Similarly, the bivariate analysis of venousand arterial thrombosis yielded a genetic correlation notsigni®cantly different from 1 and suggests that many ofthe same genes are involved in the pathogenesis of ve-nous and arterial events. Additionally, there is epide-miological evidence that similar pathways are involvedin venous and arterial thrombosis, as evidenced by the
correlation between critical risk factors (such as hom-ocysteine, vWF, and FVIII) and both venous and arterialthrombosis. Although unique local environmental fac-tors can separately in¯uence thrombogenesis in veinsand arteries, the evidence suggests that much of theunderlying process is driven by a common set of genes.Pooling of these two categories of thrombosis clearlyimproved the power of the present study. However, evenif we disaggregate these components and analyze onlyvenous thrombosis, our results are effectively unchan-ged (data not shown) except for predictable alterationsin observed signi®cance values resulting from the de-creased overall prevalence of disease.
Finally, these results provide strong support for using
genome scans to localize and evaluate the speci®c QTLsinvolved in thrombosis susceptibility. We hope to usethe information on the genetic correlations betweenthrombosis and quantitative phenotypes obtained inthis study to maximize our potential for mapping theresponsible QTLs in a genome scan currently under way.
