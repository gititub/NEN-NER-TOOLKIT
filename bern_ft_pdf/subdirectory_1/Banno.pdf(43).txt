Basal APTT values in the absence of added APC were not different

Pros1E/E, 23.360.6 s; Pros11/2, 23.360.6 s).
The plasma PS antigen levels were normal in Pros11/Emice
(98.2%67.9%) and Pros1E/E(95.7%66.4%) mice, indicating that
PS-K196E mutant was normally secreted into blood but had reduced
APC anticoagulant cofactor activity (Figure 1B). In contrast, the PS
antigen levels were reduced in Pros11/2mice (57.7% 63.5%), cor-
responding to around 50% reduction in the APC cofactor activity.
In vitro APC cofactor activity of recombinant mouse
PS-K196E mutant
To characterize further the effect of K196E mutation on the antico-
agulant activity of PS, we prepared recombinant mouse wild-type PS
and the PS-K196E mutant and compare d their APC cofac tor activities
using 2 different in vitro assays. In a modi ﬁed APTT assay, PS-K196E
showed 60% APC cofactor activity compared with wild-type PS
(Figure 2A). In an FXa 1-stage clotting assay, PS-K196E similarly
showed 49% APC cofactor activity compared with wild-type PS
(Figure 2B). Thus, the puri ﬁed PS-K196E mutant had 49% to 60% of
normal PS APC cofactor activity.
Exacerbation of VTE in PS-K196E mice
To investigate the effects of PS-K196E mutation on VTE, we per-
formed DVT and PE model experiments. In the DVT model ex-
periment, we applied the electrolytic IVC injury to Pros11/1,Pros11/E,
Pros1E/E,Pros11/2, and homozygous FV-R504Q ( FvQ/Q) mice. In this
model, thrombus formatio n under continuous blood ﬂow is induced by
endothelial activation at the site of anodal electrolysis and thrombi grow
to a maximum size at 2 days after the injury.34In this study, we applied
milder electrolytic stimulation (200 mA, 10 minutes) than that of the
original method (250 mA, 15 minutes) to adequately assess prothrom-
botic states in mice. We measured thrombus weight in IVC at 2 days
after the injury and found enhanced thrombus formation in Pros1E/E,
Pros11/2,a n d FvQ/Qmice compared with Pros11/1mice (Figure 3A).
Accompanying the increase in thrombus weight, peripheral platelet
counts were decreased, and plasma TAT and IL-6 levels were increased
inPros1E/E,Pros11/2,a n d FvQ/Qmice compared with Pros11/1mice
(Figure 3B-D). In Pros11/Emice, thrombus weight, plasma TAT, and
IL-6 levels were modestly, although not signi ﬁcantly, increased and
platelet counts were signi ﬁcantly decreased compared with Pros11/1
mice. Platelet counts, plasma TAT, a nd IL-6 levels in nontreated mice
were not different among the mouse groups. IL-6 has been shown to play
a key role in promoting in ﬂammation in mouse DVT models.40,41Thus,
these results suggest that PS-K196E mutation in mice promotes venous
thrombus formation accompanied by enhancement of coagulation and
inﬂammatory responses.
In the PE model experiments, we infused recombinant human TF or
HMW polyP into mouse IVC. PolyP is a linear polymer of inorganic
phosphates that is ubiquitous from bacteria to humans. PolyP acts as a
natural negatively charged surface t hat activates the intrinsic pathway
of blood coagulation.36After the induction of PE in mice by TF or
HMW polyP, we evaluated the 20-minute survival (Figure 4A-B,
respectively). Using a scoring scale from no occlusion (score 0) to
complete occlusion (score 4) (Figure 4C), we determined the degree of
lung vascular occlusion by perfusion with Evans blue (Figure 4D-E).
The survival was signi ﬁcantly reduced in Pros11/E,Pros1E/E,Pros11/2,
andFvQ/Qmice compared with Pros11/1mice in both TF-induced
and HMW polyP-induced PE models. The lung perfusion defect score
was inversely correlated with survival and signi ﬁcantly increased in
Pros1E/E,Pros11/2,a n dFvQ/Qmice after TF-induced PE, and in Pros11/E,
Pros1E/E,Pros11/2, and FvQ/Qmice after HMW polyP-induced PE.These results suggest that the PS-K196E mutation in mice increases
lung vascular occlusion and mortality after induction of PE.
No exacerbation of ischemic stroke in PS-K196E mice
To examine the effects of PS-K196E mutation on arterial ischemic
diseases, transient MCA ischemia-reperfusion injury was applied in mice
using the 3-VO technique.
