8). The incidence of a STP as ﬁrst event was 0.5% per year(95% CI 0.3–0.8) in the thrombophilic subjects and 0.1% peryear (95% CI 0.0–0.2) in the controls (Table 2) with a relativerisk of 5.2 (95% CI 2.0–13.7), adjusted for sex, age at entry andcenter effects (crude relative risk: 5.3; 95% CI 2.1–13.5).
The annual incidence of a ﬁrst DVT or PE was highest for
thrombophilic individuals with antithrombin deﬁciency (1.7%
year
)1; 95% CI 0.8–3.3) or combined defects (1.6% year)1; 95%
CI 0.5–3.7) and lowest in thrombophilic individuals with thefactor V Leiden mutation (0.1% year
)1; 95% CI 0.0–0.6)
(Table 2). Unfortunately, the numbers per type of defect weretoo small to estimate the risks by age and sex. Our databasecontained subtype information (or sufﬁcient level informationto determine the subtype) of 120 protein C deﬁcient individuals,97 individuals with protein S deﬁciency and 76 individuals with
antithrombin deﬁciency. When we included in the analysis onlyTable 1 General characteristics at inclusion

individuals known to have subtype I (103 with protein C
deﬁciency, 68 with protein S deﬁciency and 59 with antithrom-bin deﬁciency), the risk of a major event was similar to the risk inTable 2. The risk of thrombosis in those with a type II defect ortype III protein S defect was not lower than in those with type Iabnormalities, although the number of individuals ( n¼63) with
type II or III defects was low (results not shown).

(Table 2). In controls, the incidences of a ﬁrst DVT or PE didnot differ between the sexes (Table 2). The percentage of womenabove the age of 50 using hormone replacement therapy wasslightly lower in thrombophilic women (22%) compared withcontrols (30%), whereas a much lower percentage of women
with inherited thrombophilia used estrogen-containing oral
contraceptives (13%; age 10–50 years) compared with thecontrol women (39%; age 10–50 years). The incidence of a ﬁrstDVT or PE in thrombophilic women who did not use oralcontraceptives (age 10–50 years) was 0.4% year

0.1–0.9) compared with 0.5% year)1(95% CI 0.0–2.9) in women
using estrogen-containing oral contraceptives.The ﬁrst DVT or PE occurred about 20 years earlier in the
thrombophilic individuals than in the controls (Table 2). Themean age at onset was /C2440 years for individuals with protein
C-, protein S- or antithrombin deﬁciency or combined defectsand 63 years for the subject with factor V Leiden, incomparison to 63 years in the controls (Table 2).
The risk of a ﬁrst DVT or PE was 1.0% per year (95% CI
0.6–1.6) among the 285 thrombophilic individuals who
encountered acquired risk factors during prospective follow-up and who did not receive short-term anticoagulation duringthese risk situations (i.e. surgery, hospitalization, bed rest formore than 13 days, plaster cast, cancer, pregnancy or travelingfor more than 8 h). Table 3 shows the frequency of venousevents associated with the presence of acquired risk factorsduring prospective follow-up for which no short-term pro-
phylactic anticoagulant treatment was provided.
