per 1000 person years for women), but similar for bothmen and women in the controls (0.3 per 1000 person yearsfor men and 0.2 per 1000 person years for women)(Table 3).
The probability of being free of venous events before study
entry in the thrombophilic individuals (probands excluded) was91% (95% CI 89–93%) at age 30, 82% (95% CI 79–86%) at
age 45 and 70% (95% CI 65–76%) at age 60 (Fig. 1). Per type
of defect, the probability of being free of venous events at age45 was 87% with protein C deﬁciency, 74% with protein Sdeﬁciency, 80% with antithrombin deﬁciency, 94% with FVLeiden and 67% with combined defects. In the controls, theprobability of being free of venous thrombosis at age 30, 45 and60 was, respectively, 100%, 99% (95% CI 98–100%) and 98%(95% CI 97–99%) (Fig. 1).
The risk of venous thrombosis derived from the incidences
of venous events experienced before study entry was 16 timeshigher in the relatives with thrombophilia compared with thecontrols (relative risk of 15.7; 95% CI 9.2–26.8) andremained similar after adjustment for center and sex (relativerisk of 16.4; 95% CI 9.6–28.0) (Table 4). Per type ofthrombophilia the relative risk differed greatly: the highestrisk was found in the relatives with combined defects. For
the relatives with single defects, the risk was highest in
relatives with protein S deﬁciency (32.4; 95% CI 16.7–62.9)and lowest in the relatives with the FV Leiden mutation (4.3;95% CI 1.9–9.7) (Table 4). Exclusion of homozygousindividuals with the FV Leiden mutation did not affectthese estimates. The relative risk was higher in men than inwomen: 18.1 (95% CI 9.0–36.3) and 13.9 (95% CI 6.0–32.4),respectively (Table 4).Table 2 Description of objectively conﬁ rmed venous events before study

Discussion
To obtain reliable estimates of the risk of venous thrombosis
associated with familial thrombophilia caused by variousdefects, we started a prospectiv e collaborative multinational
study including 1626 individuals with inherited thrombophiliaand 1212 controls from eight European countries.
Data collected at study entry on the history of venous
thrombosis prior to study inclusion showed a 16 timesincreased risk of VTEs for the individuals with inherited
thrombophilia (only relatives of probands included) comparedwith the normal population (crude relative risk of 15.7 (95% CI
9.2–26.8), adjusted relative risk of 16.4 (95% CI 9.6 –28.0)
adjusted for sex and regional effects). The incidence of venousevents before study entry was 4.4 per 1000 person years in therelatives, compared with 0.3 per 1000 person years in thecontrols.
The highest incidence of events and the lowest age at onset
before study entry were found in the relatives with combineddefects (8.4 per 1000 person years; mean age at onset 28 years),
as has been described by other authors [11,20–25], For single
defects we found the highest risk with protein S deﬁciency (7.1per 1000 person years), and the lowest for FV Leiden (1.5 per1000 person years). Although there is one report that protein Sdeﬁciency confers the highest risk of VTE [26], several othershave shown that the greatest venous thromboembolic risk isassociated with antithrombin deﬁciency [23,24,27,28]. Whetherthere are real differences in the venous thrombotic risk in
respect of antithrombin and protein S deﬁciency remains
unresolved.
