 We previously observed that both FvQ/1and
FvQ/Qmice showed increased infarct volumes compared with wild-type
mice 24 hours after the ischemia-reperfusion injury induced by the
same technique.42However, infarct volumes 24 hours after ischemia in
Pros11/E,Pros1E/E,a n dPros11/2mice were not different from those in

score were also not different among the mouse groups (data not shown).
These results suggest that PS-K196E mutation in mice does not cause
aggravation of ischemic stroke, unlike FV Leiden mutation.
Discussion
To assess the pathogenic causality of the PS K196E mutation for venous
thrombosis, we established colonies of PS-K196E knockin mice and
PS-KO mice.43Plasma from PS-K196E homozygous mice had 67%
of normal APC cofactor activity, similar to puri ﬁed recombinant mu-
rine PS-K196E that had 49% to 60% APC cofactor activity. Mouse
C4BP does not contain the PS-binding subunit, the b-chain, which is

was performed in triplicate, and data are shown as mean 6SD.2250 BANNO et al BLOOD, 5 NOVEMBER 2015 xVOLUME 126, NUMBER 19a pseudogene in mice,44so interpretation of APC cofactor activity
is uncomplicated by C4BP considerations. The susceptibility of
PS-K196E mice to venous thrombosis was determined in multiple
models, including (1) an electrolytic IVC model of venous thrombosis
that produces a nonocclusive and consistent IVC thrombus in the pres-
ence of constant blood ﬂow, (2) TF-initiated pulmonary thrombosis, and
(3) HMW-polyP –initiated pulmonary thrombosis. All thrombotic bio-
markers or parameters in these thrombosis injury models, including
mortality, showed that the PS-K196E mutation caused increased venous
thrombosis, generally very similar to PS heterozygosity and to the
murine FV Leiden mutation. Heterozygosity for this PS mutation gavea milder thrombotic phenotype than PS mutant homozygosity. These
results unambiguously demonstrate a causal link between the PS-K196E
mutation and thrombophi lia, strongly supporting the PS-K196E muta-
tion as a human genetic risk factor for VTE.8-11
The PS lysine residue 196 is located in the second EGF-like domain,

monkey, mouse, rat, opossum, cattle, dog, pig, chicken, and Xenopus ,
indicating its importance for the PS function. Based on modeling of the
tertiary structure of the second EG F-like domain of PS, Lys-196 is on
the surface of the molecule,2where it likely interacts with APC.
Consistent with this interpretation for the molecular defect of PS-K196E,
