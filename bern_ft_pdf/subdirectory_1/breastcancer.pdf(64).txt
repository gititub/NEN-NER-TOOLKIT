Cancer   November 1, 2019ESR1 mutant models have been used to demonstrate 
other potential targetable pathways, such as the unfolded 
protein response (UPR) and stemness pathways. Mao  
et al74 showed that Y537S and D538G mutant cells have 
constitutive hyperactivation of the UPR pathway, and that this may contribute to the ET-resistant phenotype of ESR1 Y537S and D538G mutant cells. The ER bio -
modulator BHPI activates UPR, which causes inhibition of protein synthesis and cell death. Treatment of T47D ESR1 WT and mutant cells with BHPI decreased estro -
gen-stimulated growth and further enhanced growth reduction with tamoxifen or fulvestrant. Furthermore, activation of progesterone receptor with progestin was associated with increased resistance to anti-estrogen therapies and further activation of the UPR pathway in ESR1 mutant cells as measured by downstream markers, 
such as spliced XBP1. Treatment with BHPI reduced 
progestin-stimulated growth. Collectively, this study demonstrated that UPR activation contributes to the ET-resistant phenotype associated with ESR1 mutation 
expression. Gelsomino et al
75 demonstrated that the 
Y537S ESR1 mutation increases a stem cell–like pheno -
type. Y537S ESR1 mutant cells exhibited a higher per -
centage of CD44 +/CD24 − cells compared with WT 
ESR1 cells and had enhanced Notch signaling, indicat -
ing that these cells represent a more stem-like progenitor. 
Therapeutic screening of stem cell pathway inhibitors 
enhanced Notch signaling in ESR1 mutant cells, which 
was mediated through phosphorylation of residue S118 in Y537S ER. Furthermore, inhibition of Notch signal -
ing using the RO4929097 selective inhibitor reduced mammosphere formation efficiency, but inhibitors of 
other stem cell pathways such as the Wnt/B-catenein and 
sonic hedgehog were not effective. These collective re -
sults show that ESR1 mutant cells have enriched stem cell properties through Notch signaling and that this path -
way could be potentially targeted in patients with ESR1 
mutant-expressing tumors.
An additional novel strategy to overcome ET resis -
tance is to therapeutically target epigenetic modifying proteins to either inhibit ER transcriptional activity or 
resensitize tumor cells to ET by modifying ER expression and chromatin binding. The JQ1 inhibitor targets the BET family of bromodomain proteins, and the HDAC inhibi -
tor vorinostat has been tested in an ESR1 D538G model and demonstrated effective reduction of tumor growth and ER transcriptional activity when treated in combination 
with fulvestrant.
72 Unfortunately, the BET inhibitors have 
shown widespread toxicity in clinical trials. The efficacy of 
the HDAC inhibitor entinostat has been tested in clinical trials in combination with ET. In the phase 2 ENCORE301 
trial, patients with ER-positive advanced breast cancer were treated with either exemestane or in combination with 
entinostat.
77,78 There was an improvement in PFS (4.3 
vs 2.3 months) and OS (28.1 vs 19.8 months) with the combination, leading to the initiation of the larger phase 3 E2112 trial (NCT02115282).
79 Because preclinical stud -
ies suggest that ESR1 mutant cells are sensitive to HDAC inhibition in combination with ET, it would be valuable 
to see whether clinical trials with tamoxifen or fulvestrant 
can be developed further and whether patients with ESR1  
mutations derive benefit from these combinations. Figure 2 shows potential targetable pathways in ESR1 m tumors and 
highlights several inhibitors used in preclinical and clinical 
studies to target these pathways. However, use of the PI3K 
inhibitors alpelisib and taselisib will have to be evaluated 
further to determine whether patients with ESR1 mutant − 
bearing tumors derive clinical benefit. These studies demonstrate there are several new targets that could poten -
tially be actionable in the clinic; however, there is an urgent 
need to continue developing clinical trials of inhibitors of 
these novel targets.
