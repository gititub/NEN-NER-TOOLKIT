IN PRECLINICAL STUDIES
Several studies have shown that ESR1 LBD mutations 
are constitutively active and are less sensitive to the ER 
antagonists tamoxifen and fulvestrant.13-16 In vitro stud -
ies have shown that the Y537S and D538G mutations required higher concentrations of antagonist to decrease 
ER signaling compared with the wild-type (WT) recep -
tor. Molecular modeling of the Y537S and D538G ESR1 LBD mutations showed that these mutations are in an 
apo-receptor conformation and are constitutively active,  
even upon antagonist binding.
15,17 These mutations  
induced changes in protein structure, which resulted in reduced ligand affinity, and this may be one potential 
mechanism for their ligand-independent activity and ET 
resistance. In the absence of ligand, the mutant receptors 
exhibited increased hydrogen bonding between Y537S 
and N348, which was similar to the estrogen-bound WT 
receptor. Mutant receptors also had enhanced protein 
stability compared with the WT receptor when bound 
to fulvestrant. Several studies have shown that the most common ESR1 LBD mutations also recruited coactiva -
tors, such as SRC-1 and SRC-3, in the absence of ligand that further potentiated ER transcription.
18,19 Therefore, 
it was concluded that the altered structure of ESR1 mu -
tations conferred ET resistance and potentiated distinct mechanisms of resistance through enhanced coactivator 
recruitment.
The transcriptomes of WT and mutant ERs have 
been described by several groups, showing there are shared, classical ER signaling signatures, as well as  
mutant-specific transcriptional regulation.
20-22 Using in 
vitro–derived ESR1 mutant cell line models generated 
using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, or through natural  
selection of cells in hormone-deprived conditions, Martin  
et al23 showed that there was a high overlap between  
ER chromatin binding sites of estrogen-stimulated WT receptor and hormone-deprived mutant receptors. They 
further showed that estrogen treatment of both the WT 
and Y537S models exhibited a 74% concordance in ER 
binding sites. These results suggest that there are hor -
mone-dependent but also independent mechanisms of mutant gene regulation and that the unique constitu -
tive mutant-specific ER binding sites and transcriptional regulation should be studied further to better under -
stand the role of the ESR1 mutant in tumor growth and 
progression.
Recent studies by Jeselsohn et al
20 demonstrated 
that the models expressing the Y537S mutation was rel -
atively more resistant to growth inhibition when treated with tamoxifen or fulvestrant compared with D538G 
and WT, which is consistent with many published stud -
ies. The Y537S and D538G mutations exhibited differ -
ent cistromes and transcriptomes compared with WT  
ESR1 . Specifically, gene expression analyses comparing 
estrogen-bound WT receptor with hormone-deprived 
Y537S and D538G mutant receptors showed little over -
lap of shared gene expression (18% and 33%, respec -
tively). Furthermore, there was minimal upregulation of gene expression when Y537S mutant cells were treated Figure 1.  Location of ESR1  missense mutations found in clinical samples. Of 62 identified mutations, 47 occurred in the ligand

Cancer   November 1, 2019with estrogen (12 genes), but there was a significant  
increase in gene expression when D538G mutant- 
expressing cells were treated with estrogen (416 genes), 
and many of these genes were unique to each mutation. 
Transcriptome analysis of MBC patient tumors harbor -
ing ESR1 mutations showed a high correlation with pro -
files obtained from these cell line models as analyzed by 
gene set enrichment analysis, validating the significance 
of the in vitro–derived models.
