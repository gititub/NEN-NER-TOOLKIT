 Access-
ing the data using Semantic Web technologies enables tocombineDisGeNETdatawithothertypesofbiologicalin-
formation available in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud
(http://lod-cloud.net/ ). Finally, the disgenet2r R package
facilitates exploring, analysing and visualizing the data us-
ingthepowerfulgraphicalandstatisticalcapabilitiesofthe

The web interface
The DisGeNET web interface allows searching by single
gene, disease and variant, using different types of identi-
fiers.Searchingbyshortlistsofgenes,diseasesandvariantsis also possible. The user can also browse the data, using
the Browser entry point. To ease the interpretation of the
information, the different views of the web interface showannotations of the different biological entities to the afore-
mentionedattributes.Theinterfacealsoenablessortingand
filtering the data using the DisGeNET score, the DPI, theDSI, the publication year and the DisGeNET gene-disease
associationtype.Linkstootherreferenceresources,suchas
the NCBI gene, UniProt, UMLS and dbSNP, are also pro-
vided.
Programmatic access
As a result of exploring DisGeNET data using the web in-
terface, scripts in R, Perl, Python and Bash are automati-
cally generated. These scripts can be downloaded and cus-
tomizedtogeneratethesameorsimilarqueries,allowingto
reproducetheresultsoftheanalysisperformedthroughthe
web interface and to incorporate DisGeNET data as part
ofautomaticcomputationalworkflows.Additionally,inthedownloads section of the website, several exemplary scripts
areprovidedtoperformqueriestotheDisGeNETdatabase,
with usecase examples.
The DisGeNET Cytoscape App
The DisGeNET Cytoscape plugin ( 1) has been updated to
correspond to Cytoscape versions 3.0 or higher. The Dis-
GeNET Cytoscape App allows visualization of the GDAs
as bipartite networks, and also exploration of the data in a
diseaseorgene-centricway.AvarietyoffeaturescanbeusedD836NucleicAcidsResearch,2017,Vol.45,Databaseissue

the DisGeNET gene-disease association type, data source

a particular gene, or disease. The DisGeNET CytoscapeApp, and a detailed tutorial on how to use it, are available
for download at http://disgenet.org/web/DisGeNET/menu/
app.
DisGeNET-RDF
DisGeNET data are also published as machine-readable
data through DisGeNET-RDF ( 23) and nanopublications
(24) linked data sets, which increases the FAIRness of
the data ( 25). Entities and properties in DisGeNET-RDFare semantically defined making extensive reuse of stan-
dard identifiers, vocabularies and ontologies such as the
National Cancer Institute thesaurus, for medical vocabu-
lary and the Semanticscience Integrated Ontology ( 26)f o r
general science. DisGeNET-RDF is interlinked to other
biomedical databases available in the LOD cloud that en-
ables performing complex queries that need the interroga-tion of different resources to be answered. The DisGeNET
SPARQL endpoint allows exploration of the DisGeNET-
RDF data set and query federation to expand DisGeNETgene-disease association information with data on gene ex-
pression,drugactivityandbiologicalpathways,amongoth-
ers. Representative queries linking the data to other re-NucleicAcidsResearch,2017,Vol.45,Databaseissue D837
sources such as Wikipathways ( 27), ChEMBL ( 28) and the
Gene Expression Atlas ( 29) are available at the RDF page
in the website ( http://www.disgenet.org/web/DisGeNET/
menu/rdf#sparql-queries ).
The disgenet2r R package
DisGeNETdatacanalsobeaccessedviaanRpackage,dis-
genet2r. The package contains a series of functions to re-trievegene-diseaseandvariant-diseasedata,andtoperform
mappingsbetweenseveralbiomedicalvocabularies.There-
sultsofthequeriescanbevisualizedusingavarietyofplots,such as heatmaps, barplots and several types of networks.
The package is especially well suited to explore the genetic
basis of diseases, and disease comorbidities. Furthermore,thedisgenet2rpackagepermitsbenefitingfromtheSeman-

functions include retrieving the druggable targets for a dis-
ease of interest, or obtaining the biological pathways for alist of disease genes. The disgenet2r package also expedites
the integration of DisGeNET data with other R packages.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
New trends are starting to emerge in disease therapeutics.
