Summary Background : We started a large multicenter pros-
pective follow-up study to provide reliable risk estimates ofvenous thrombosis in families with various thrombophilicdefects. Objectives : This paper describes data collected at study
entry on venous events experienced before study inclusion, i.e.
the baseline data. Patients/methods : All individuals (probands,
relatives) registered in nine European thrombosis centers withthe factor (F)V Leiden mutation, a deﬁciency of antithrombin,protein C or protein S, or a combination of these defects, wereenrolled between March 1994 and September 1997. As controlindividuals, partners, friends or acquaintances of the thrombo-philic participants were included. Incidence and relative risk of
objectively conﬁrmed venous thrombotic events (VTEs) prior to
entry were calculated for the relatives with thrombophilia andthe controls. Results : Of the 846 relatives with thrombophilia
(excluding probands), 139 (16%) had experienced a VTE withan incidence of 4.4 per 1000 person years. Of the controls, 15 ofthe 1212 (1%) controls had experienced a VTE with anincidence of 0.3 per 1000 person years. The risk of venousthrombosis associated with familial thrombophilia was 15.7
(95% CI 9.2–26.8) and remained similar after adjustment for
regional and sex-eﬀects (16.4; 95% CI 9.6–28.0). The highestincidence per 1000 person years was found in relatives withcombined defects (8.4; 95% CI 5.6–12.2), and the lowestincidence was found in those with the FV Leiden mutation (1.5;
95% CI 0.8–2.6). Conclusions : Considerable diﬀerences in the
lifetime risk of VTE were observed among individuals withdiﬀerent thrombophilia defects.

Introduction
In developed countries, venous thrombosis occurs in 1–2 per
1000 individuals per year [1,2] and commonly manifests as deepvein thrombosis (DVT), with or without pulmonary embolism
(PE) [3]. Major complications in the clinical course of DVT are
death from PE, development of a disabling post–thromboticsyndrome and recurrences [2,4–6]. Predisposing factors forvenous thrombosis can be genetic or acquired, or both, andmay lead to a life-long or temporary increase in the tendency tovenous thrombosis (thrombophilia) [7]. As the clinical expres-sion varies between individuals who are heterozygous for thesame genetic thrombotic defect , as shown within genotypically
identical family members [8], venous thrombosis is believed to
be a multicausal disease [9,10]. The hypothesis of multicausalpathogenesis is underlined by the ﬁnding that the risk of venousthrombosis is higher in families with inherited thrombophiliathan in individuals with the same defect without a positivefamily history [11,12]. This difference probably is the result ofinteraction within these families of the inherited defect withother genetic or acquired risk factors [11–13]. Several hered-
itary prothrombotic defects have been identiﬁed in the last four
decades. The ﬁrst was antithrombin deﬁciency, identiﬁed in
