 The absence of a difference in our study mightreﬂect differences in the distribution of, yet unknown, inter-acting second defects or the presence of the prothrombinG20210A mutation for which 36% of the participants couldnot be tested. It is, however, noteworthy, that a populationstudy, in which selection or referral bias was excluded, also didnot ﬁnd a higher risk for antithrombin deﬁciency [29]. Another
possible explanation for these conﬂicting results is that since
antithrombin deﬁciency was the ﬁrst thrombophilia to bediscovered, affected individuals could have received prophy-laxis more frequently than individuals with other typesof thrombophilia. However, when the year of diagnosisof thrombophilia was taken as follow-up end-point instead ofthe age at which individuals were without venous events atstudy entry, the incidence was only slightly higher for
individuals with antithrombin deﬁciency: 5.9% (95% CI 3.8–
8.7).Table 3 Incidence per 1000 person years of venous events befo re study entry in the controls and the relatives

The annual risk of thrombophilia-associated venous
thrombosis before study entry was sex-dependent: the inci-dence was higher in male relatives than in female relatives,but similar for both male and female controls. As manyvenous thrombotic events in young women can be attributedto oral contraception, the low percentage of asymptomaticthrombophilic women using oral contraceptives (16%; age
15–35) compared with asymptomatic female controls (37%;
age 15–35) offers a likely explanation for a lower risk inwomen with thrombophilia compared with control women.Another explanation is that female relatives were referred toa thrombosis clinic for investigation before hormone pre-scription or pregnancy, whereas men were only referred whenthey were symptomatic.
Labelling events as provoked or unprovoked is difﬁcult and
mostly dependent on the researcher’s deﬁnition of a provoked
event, e.g. we labeled events occuring during oral contraceptiveuse as unprovoked, as oral contraceptive use is a generallyweak and very common risk factor during which anticoagu-lation treatment is mostly not considered.
