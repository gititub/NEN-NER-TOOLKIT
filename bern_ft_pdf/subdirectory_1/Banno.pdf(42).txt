 Lungs were
excised, photographed, and scored for Evans blue perfusion defects using a
scoring scale (from 0 for no occlusion to 4 for complete occlusion). The scores
were evaluated by 2 individuals anonymously.
Transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion model
Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury was induced using the 3-vessel occlusion
technique as described previously.38,39In brief, the left common carotid artery
was isolated and occluded by a vascular clip (1-vessel occlusion [1-VO]) under
halothane inhalation-anesthesia. A skin incision was made at the midpoint
between the left orbit and the external auditory canal. After the removal of the
zygomatic bone and downward retraction of the mandibular bone, a craniectomy
was made using an electric drill. The distal M1 portion of left MCA, peripheral to
the perforating arteries of the basal ganglia, was permanently occluded (2-vessel
occlusion [2-VO]) by elect rocauterization and cut at the lateral edge of the
olfactory tract. Finally, the right common carotid artery was occluded (3-vessel
occlusion [3-VO]) using a vascular clip. After 15-minute focal ischemia induced

reperfusion through the collateral arteries (the source of the vascular reserve)
distal to the 1-VO in the cortex. During the operation, blood pressure was mon-
itored by an indirect blood pressure meter (BP-98A; Softron, Tokyo, Japan) and
rectal temperature was regulated within the range of 36.5 to 37.5°C by a tem-
perature controller (NS-TC10; Neuroscience, Tokyo, Japan). After 24 hours,

tetrazolium chloride. The infarcted and th e total hemispheric areas of each section
were measured using a computer-assisted image-analysis system (WinROOF;
Mitani, Tokyo, Japan).31,39The infarct volume was adjusted for edema by dividing
the volume by the edema index (left hemisphere volume/right hemisphere volume).
Statistical analysis
Statistical signi ﬁcance was assessed by the 1-way analysis of variance
followed by the post hoc Bonferroni ’s multiple comparison test. Data for
nonnormal and nonparametric distributions were assessed by the Kruskal-Wallis
test followed by the post hoc Dunn ’s multiple comparison t est. Survival rates
were analyzed by the Mantel-Cox log-rank test. Differences were considered to
be signi ﬁcant at P,.05.
Results
Generation of PS-K196E and PS-KO mice
To generate PS-K196E mice, we introduced the K196E mutation into
the endogenous Pros1 gene by homologous recombination (supple-
mental Figure 1A). We con ﬁrmed the expected struc ture of the targeted
locus by polymerase chain reactio n (data not shown) and Southern
blotting (supplemental Figure 1B). Pros1 messenger RNA was de-
tected in PS-K196E mice with normal sizes ( ;3.5 kb) and amounts by
the northern blot analysis of liver to tal RNA (supplemental Figure 1C).
Expression of the mutant messenger RNA in PS-K196E mice was
veriﬁed by the appearance of 238-bp and 171-bp fragments in reverse-
transcription polymerase chain reaction products after digestion with NruI
(supplemental Figure 1D) and by direct sequencing of the products. To
generate PS-KO mice, we disrupted the Pros1 gene in a similar manner
using a targeting vector that eliminated exon 3 (supplemental Figure 2).
Genotyping of 299 offspring by intercrosses in heterozygous
PS-K196E ( Pros11/E) mice showed the expected 1:2:1 Mendelian
distribution of Pros11/1(82/299, 27.4%), Pros11/E(149/299,
49.8%), and Pros1E/E(68/299, 22.7%). Pros1E/Emice were viableand fertile. In contrast, no Pros12/2pups were obtained in a total of
316 pups from Pros11/2intercrosses, as previously reported.3,28
Pros11/1andPros11/2mice were born in the 1:2 distribution
(109/316 [34.5%] and 207/316 [65.5%], respectively) by Pros11/2mice
intercrosses, and Pros11/2mice grew normally. Thus, although PS
is essential for embryonic development in mice, the homozygous
PS-K196E mutation did not cause embryonic lethality. In addition,
Pros1E/2mice were viable when Pros1E/Emice were bred with
Pros11/2mice.
Plasma APC cofactor activities and PS antigens in PS-K196E
and PS-KO mice
We measured plasma APC cofactor activity by an APTT-based clotting
assay in the absence and presence of recombinant mouse APC as
previously reported.33The APC cofactor activity determined from
the prolongation of clotting time by APC was signi ﬁcantly reduced in
Pros11/E,Pros1E/E,a n d Pros11/2mice compared with Pros11/1mice
(Figure 1A). Similar to human Pros11/Esubjects, Pros11/Emice had
;18% lower activity (82.0% 69.5%, mean 6SD) than Pros11/1mice
(100%618.0%). More severe reductions in the activity were observed
inPros1E/E(67.1% 67.
