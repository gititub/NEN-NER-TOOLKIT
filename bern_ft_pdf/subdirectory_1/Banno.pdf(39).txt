Key Points
 A protein S-K196E mutation
reduced its activated protein C
cofactor activity in recombinant
murine protein S-K196E
and in K196E mutant mice.
 Mice carrying a protein S-K196E
mutation or heterozygous
protein S deficiency were more
vulnerable to venous
thrombosis than wild-type mice.Protein S (PS) acts as an anticoagulant cofactor for activated protein C in regulation of
blood coagulation. The K196E mutation in PS is a race-specific genetic risk factor for
venous thromboembolism with a prevalence of ∼2% within the Japanese population. To
evaluate the thrombosis risk of the PS-K196E mutation, we generated PS-K196E knockin
mice and heterozygous PS-deficient mice. We analyzed their thrombotic states, com-
paring with mice carrying the factor V Leiden mutation(FV-R504Q), a race-specific genetic
risk for venous thrombosis in whites. PS-K196E mice grew normally but had decreased
activated protein C cofactor activity in plasma. Purified recombinant murine PS-K196E
showed the same decreased activated protein C cofactor activity. A deep vein thrombosis
model of electrolytic inferior vena cava injury and pulmonary embolism models induced
by infusion of tissue factor or polyphosphates revealed that PS-K196E mice, heterozy-
gous PS-deficient mice, and FV-R504Q mice were much more susceptible to venous
thrombosis compared with wild-type mice. Transient middle cerebral artery ischemia-
reperfusion injury model studies demonstrated that both PS-K196E mice and heterozy-
gous PS-deficient mice had cerebral infarction similar to wild-type mice, consistent with human observations. Our in vitro and in vivo
results support a causal relationship between the PS-K196E mutation and venous thrombosis and indicate that PS-K196E mice can
provide an in vivo evaluation system to help uncovering racial differences in thrombotic diseases. ( Blood . 2015;126(19):2247-2253)
Introduction
Protein S (PS) is a vitamin K –dependent plasma glycoprotein that is
mainly synthesized in liver and end othelial cells. PS acts as an anti-
coagulant cofactor for activated protein C (APC) in the proteolytic in-
activation of factor Va (FVa) and factor VIIIa (FVIIIa) and negatively
regulates blood coagulation.1,2In human plasma, ;60% of PS forms
a complex with C4b binding protein (C4BP), and the formation of this
complex abolishes the APC cofactor activity of PS. PS also acts as
a cofactor for tissue factor pathway inhibitor during the inhibition of
factor Xa (FXa) in human plasma, but this cofactor activity has not been
detected in mouse plasma.3
PS de ﬁciency is a risk factor for developing venous thromboem-
bolism (VTE).4Homozygous or compound heterozygous PS de ﬁ-
ciency is an extremely rare disorder that causes purpura fulminans in
affected newborns.5Heterozygous PS de ﬁciency is milder but ﬁrmly
associated with an increased risk of VTE.4The risk of thrombosis in
individuals with PS de ﬁciency is increased with other genetic or
acquired factors predisposing to thrombosis.
A rare variant in the PS gene, PROS1 , that is present in 1.8% of
Japanese, which causes a Lys196 t o Glu substitution in PS (PS-K196E,
rs 121918474, c.586A .G, also known as PS Tokushima,6PS-K155Ein the mature protein numbering7) is a genetic risk factor for VTE in the
Japanese population (odds ratio 53.7-8.6).8-11The K196E mutation
in PS is located in the second epid ermal growth factor (EGF)-like
domain.2,7,9,11-14We estimate that ;1 out of every 12 000 Japanese in-
dividuals is homozygous for the 196E allele, representing a total of as
many as 10 000 individuals.13Thus, a substantial number of Japanese
carry the mutant PS 196E allele, as a heterozygote or homozygote, and
a likely risk of development of VTE. The phenotype-genotype analysis
in individuals with PS-K196E mutation showed that heterozygotes
had 16% lower PS anticoagulant activ ity than wild-type individuals,
although the anticoagulant activities between heterozygotes and wild-
types are substantially overlapped.12PS-K196E mutation appears to be
a genetic risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) during pregnancy,15and
PS-K196E mutation concomitant with other predisposing mutations for
thrombosis was found in patients with VTE.
