The Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation  
Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT)  
panel was developed as an alternative to NGS to  
detect selected common cancer gene mutations with high sensitivity.
4 Using this mutational profiling tech -
nology, ESR1 mutation status was analyzed in archival 
samples from a cohort of 929 breast cancer patients who were treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer 
Center. In this analysis, mutations were found in 3.5% 
(11/313) of primary breast tumors and 13.6% (84/616) 
of metastatic tumors. Furthermore, ESR1 mutations 
were found in ER-positive samples, but not triple-neg -
ative cancers.
12 ESR1 mutations were also identified in 
7.9% (10/126) of ER-positive/HER2-positive patients,

Cancer   November 1, 2019suggesting that ESR1 mutations might also play a 
role in HER2 patients who undergo HER2-targeted  
therapy; therefore, further investigation will be needed to evaluate ESR1 mutant–specific biology in a  
HER2-positive background to determine whether 
patients with mutations have a different treatment 
outcome.
Additional studies using the MSK-IMPACT plat -
form compared genomic alterations between early breast cancer and MBC.
29 These analyses demonstrated that 
ER-positive, but not HER2-positive or triple-negative 
breast cancers, had a significant enrichment of addi -
tional driver mutations in metastatic tumors compared 
with early breast cancer. Some of these mutated genes 
are downstream of ER regulation or are involved in the 
regulation of ER itself, including the transcriptional reg -
ulators KMT2C , NCOR1 , and AKT1 . These findings 
suggest that ESR1 mutant–positive breast cancers evolve 
and acquire distinct and perhaps targetable mechanisms driving tumor evolution that directly affect or are a con -
sequence of ER signaling.
DDPCR DETECTION OF ESR1  MUTATIONS 
IN PATIENT BIOPSIES
ddPCR technologies are increasingly being used to detect  
ESR1 mutations in both solid tumor and liquid biopsies due to the enhanced sensitivity and lower cost compared with NGS technology. Thus the increased sensitivity  
of ddPCR is allowing for more accurate positive detec-tion of ESR1 mutations from patient biopsies. Takeshita et al
30 were one of the first groups to evaluate ESR1  
mutation status (Y537S, D538G, Y537N, or Y537C) from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples (270 primary and 55 MBC tumors), and reported ESR1 muta-tion frequencies of 2.5% and 20%, respectively. Of the 11 
MBC patients with ESR1 mutations, 5 had been treated 
with an AI, 4 were treated with tamoxifen, and 2 had not had received prior ET before biopsy. Furthermore, Gelsomino et al
14 analyzed ESR1 mutation status in a 
larger cohort of 203 primary breast cancers treated with tamoxifen monotherapy, and found that the frequency of ESR1 mutations was higher (12% Y537N, 5% Y537S, 
and 2% for the D538G mutations) compared to other 
reports in the literature of unselected primary tumors. In 
addition, the presence of ESR1 mutations was associated 
with a better progression free survival in these tamoxifen-treated patients, suggesting that the use of tamoxifen might not select for or may be effective at preventing the emergence of mutation. This possibility needs to be explored.In the CARMINA02 clinical trial, which evalu -
ated the efficacy of neoadjuvant anastrozole versus ful -
vestrant, ESR1 mutations were found in 3.4% (3/89) of 
treatment-naïve tumors.
31 Technologies for assessing liq -
uid biopsies have also recently been developed, and have 
there are now commercial assays to monitor ESR1 muta -
tion status in metastatic patients. Schiavon et al26 used 
ddPCR of liquid biopsy samples from advanced breast 
cancer patients but did not detect ESR1 mutations in a 
cohort of 22 patients who were previously treated with tamoxifen in an adjuvant setting; however, they detected ESR1 mutation frequencies in 0% (0/32) to 5.8% (3/52) 
in 2 cohorts of patients who were treated with an AI in an adjuvant setting. Mutation frequencies were enriched to 36.4% (16/44) in patients who were treated with an AI in 
the metastatic setting. These data demonstrate that ESR1 mutations can preexist at low frequencies in primary  
tumors but are enriched in a metastatic setting, especially 
in AI-treated patients.
