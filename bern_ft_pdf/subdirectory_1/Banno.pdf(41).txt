 Bound
antibody was detected using SureBlue Reserve TMB Microwell Peroxidase
Substrate (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) as absorbance
change at 450 nm. The PS level measured in wild-type mouse plasma was
arbitrarily de ﬁned as 100%.
APC cofactor activity analysis of recombinant mouse PS
proteins in vitro
Recombinant mouse wild-type PS and PS-K196E mutant proteins were made as
described.33SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions revealed that the
recombinant proteins were ;95% pure (data not shown). APC cofactor activity
of recombinant PS was determined by modi ﬁed APTT and FXa 1-stage clotting
assays as described previously.33In a modi ﬁed APTT assay, 10 mLn o r m a l
mouse pooled plasma (BioreclamationIVT, Baltimore, MD), 5 mLh u m a n ﬁ-
brinogen (2 mg/mL; Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN), 25 mL
recombinant mouse APC (36 nM), 25 mL recombinant mouse PS (0, 3.38, 6.75,
13.5, and 27 nM), and 25 mL APTT-XL (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, Waltham,
MA) were mixed and incubated for 3 mi nutes at 37°C. The clotting time was
recorded after adding 25 mLC a C l 2( 2 5m M ) .I na nF X a1 - s t a g ec l o t t i n ga s s a y ,
10mL normal mouse pooled plasma, 25 mL of a mixture (4:1) of phospholipid
vesicles (25 mM, 80% 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine/20%
1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylserine; Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster,
AL) plus human ﬁbrinogen (2 mg/mL), 25 mL recombinant mouse APC
(53 nM), 25 mL recombinant mouse PS (0, 0.63, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 nM), and
25mL mouse FXa (Haematologic Technologies, Essex Junction, VT) were
mixed and incubated for 3 minutes at 37°C . The clotting time was recorded after
adding 25 mLC a C l 2(25 mM). Each assay was perfo rmed in triplicate. The APC
cofactor activity of recombinant mouse PS was evaluated based on the slope of
a linear increase in clotting time wit h the dosage of recombinant mouse PS.
DVT model
A mouse DVT model of electrolytic inf erior vena cava (IVC) injury was
performed according to the metho d of Diaz et al, with minor modi ﬁcations.34,35
Mice were anesthetized with 2.5% 2,2,2-tribromoethanol and kept around 37°C
using a heating pad (Bio Research Center, Nagoya, Japan). The IVC was exposed
through a midline laparotomy, and all side branches between the renal and iliac
veins were ligated with a 7 -0 polypropylene suture. An anode of 27G stainless-
steel needle electrode (NE-115B; Nihon Koden, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted into
the caudal IVC and attached to the anterior wall. A cathode was inserted
subcutaneously to co mplete a circuit. A dir ect current of 200 mA was applied for
10 minutes using an electric stimulator (SEN-3041; Nihon Koden) with an
isolator unit (SS-203J; Nihon Koden). After current load, the needle was gently
removed from the IVC and the abdomen was closed by polyglycolic acid suture
and cyanoacrylate glue. At 2 days postsurgery, blood was collected and platelet
counts were determ ined using an automatic cell counter (KX-21NV; Sysmex,
Kobe, Japan). Thrombi formed in the IVC were removed, weighed in wet
condition, and photographed using a digital microscope (VHX-1000; Keyence,
Osaka, Japan). Plasma thrombin-antith rombin complex (TAT) and interleukin-6
(IL-6) levels were measured using an Enzygnost TAT micro kit (Siemens AG,
Munich, Germany) and a BD OptEIA mouse IL-6 ELISA kit (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA), respectively.
PE models
A recombinant human tissue factor (TF) reagent (Dade Innovin) containing
phospholipids and calcium was purchased from S iemens AG. A high-molecular-
weight polyphosphate (HMW polyP) was prepared as reported by Smith et al.36
Sodium metaphosphate (Sigma-Aldrich Japan, Tokyo, Japan) was washed twice
with puri ﬁed water and solubilized in 250 mM LiCl. The soluble HMW polyP
(40-1200 phosphate units long) was precipitated by adding 2.5 volumes of
acetone and dissolved in puri ﬁed water. The concentrations of HMW polyP were
determined as phosphate monomer using BIOMOL Green reagent (Enzo Life
Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) after complete hydrolysis in 1 N HCl.
Mice were anesthetized with 2.5% 2,2,2-tribromoethanol, and 15 mL/g body
weight of the TF reagent (1/30 dilution) or HMW polyP (1.67 g/L) was infused
into the IVC.37The dose of TF and HMW polyP was chosen such that ;20% of2248 BANNO et al BLOOD, 5 NOVEMBER 2015 xVOLUME 126, NUMBER 19wild-type mice survived after the infus ion. Survival time was recorded until 20
minutes after the infusion, while de ﬁning death as respiratory arrest that persisted
for at least 2 minutes. Two minutes after the respiratory arrest (but while the heart
was still beating) or at the completion o f the 20-minute observation period, mice
were perfused with 0.5 mL 1% Evans blue via right ventricle.
