 To allow interoperability, and to bridge the
research and the clinical settings, DisGeNET provides awide variety of disease vocabularies. These include MeSH,
OMIM, Disease Ontology ( 15) (DO) and ICD9. Disease
attributes include the MeSH disease class, the UMLSsemantic type, the Human Phenotype Ontology ( 16)a n d
the DO upper level classes. In version 4.0, we distinguish
between abnormal phenotypes, traits, signs and symptomsfrom actual diseases using the UMLS semantic types
followed by manual curation. In addition, disease entries
referring to very general classes such as ‘CardiovascularDiseases’, ‘Autoimmune Diseases’, ‘Neurodegenerative
Diseases and ’Lung Neoplasms” are indicated as ‘disease
group’.
Gene HGNC symbols and UniProt identifiers are

DisGeNET 4.0 has made a stronger emphasis on the re-
lationship between variants and diseases. Variant-diseaseinformation in DisGeNET originates from ClinVar, the
GWAS Catalog, UniProt, GAD and from BeFree data.
VariantsareidentifiedusingtheNCBIShortGeneticVaria-tions database (dbSNP) identifiers, and annotated with the
chromosomal position, the reference and alternative alle-
les and the variant class, obtained from dbSNP database(19). Additionally, variant allele frequencies computed by
theExomeAggregationConsortium,whichaggregatesand
harmonizesexomesequencingdatafromavarietyoflarge-scale sequencing projects ( 20), and by the 1000 Genomes
Project, a public catalogue of human variation and geno-

For both, GDAs and VDAs, the publication(s) support-
ing the association, a representative sentence from each
publication and the original source are available. In Dis-GeNET 4.0 the full collection of publications supporting
each association has been made available (in previous re-

PRIORITIZATION FEATURES TO GUIDE THE EXPLO-
RATION OF THE GENETIC BASIS OF DISEASE
To help navigating the more than 400 000 GDAs in Dis-
GeNET, these are rated with a confidence score (the Dis-
GeNET score) that reflects the recurrence of a GDAacross all data sources. The DisGeNET score takes into
account the number of sources supporting the asso-
ciation and the reliability of each of them (for fur-ther details see http://disgenet.org/web/DisGeNET/menu/
dbinfo#score ). The score is updated in each release to in-
cludethenew sourcesincorporated in thedatabase.
In order to facilitate ranking the genes associated with a
disease, in this release we introduced two new metrics. The
Disease Specificity Index (DSI) ranges from 0 to 1, and isinverselyproportionaltothenumberofdiseasesassociated
toaparticulargene.Ageneassociatedtoalargenumberof
diseases (e.g. TNF, associated to more than 1500 diseases)willhaveaDSIclosetozero,whileageneassociatedtoonly
one disease, is more ‘specific’ for that disease and has DSI
of 1. The Disease Pleiotropy Index (DPI) ranges from 0 to1 and is proportional to the number of different (MeSH)
disease classes a gene is associated to. Thus, a gene associ-
atedtodiseasesofdiverseclasses(suchasAPOE,associated
toCardiovascularDiseases,MentalDisorders,Neoplasms,
Respiratory Tract Diseases, etc), will have a DPI close to1.Conversely,thePSCA,associatedto58diseases,mostof
which areneoplasms has a relativelylowDPI.
FLEXIBLE DATA ACCESS TO ANSWER DIFFERENT
RESEARCH QUESTIONS
The DisGeNET platform includes several ways of access-
ing the data, which makes it a versatile resource to an-
swer questions posed by different types of users, and to
achieve diverse goals (Figure 1). The web interface is de-
