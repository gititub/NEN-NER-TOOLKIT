19219042	TITLE	Genome-wide association study identifies a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus at 6q25.1
19219042	ABSTRACT	A genome-wide association study was conducted among Chinese women to identify risk variants for breast cancer. By analyzing 607,728 SNPs in 1505 cases and 1522 controls, we selected 29 promising SNPs for a fast-track replication in an independent set of 1554 cases and 1576 controls. Four replicated loci were further investigated in a third set of samples including 3472 cases and 900 controls. SNP rs2046210 at 6q25.1, located upstream of the estrogen receptor 1 gene (ESR1), exhibited strong and consistent association with breast cancer across all three stages. Adjusted odds ratio (95% CI) were 1.36 (1.24-1.49) and 1.59 (1.40-1.82), respectively, for genotypes A/G and A/A versus G/G (P for trend, 2.0x10-15) in the pooled analysis of samples from all three stages. A similar, although weaker, association was also found in an independent study including 1591 cases and 1466 controls of European ancestry (Ptrend, 0.01). These results provide strong evidence implicating 6q25.1 as a susceptibility locus for breast cancer.
19219042	INTRO	Breast cancer, a complex multifactorial disease, is one of the most common malignancies among women in the world. Genetic factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of both sporadic and familial breast cancer. However, only a small fraction of breast cancer cases can be explained by the breast cancer susceptibility genes identified thus far, such as the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Family-based linkage studies have been successful in mapping genes associated with Mendelian disorders. However, this approach has had limited success in identifying common genetic variants that confer small to moderate risk of disease susceptibility. Over the past 15 years, a large number of association studies have evaluated genetic variants in many candidate genes in relation to breast cancer risk. Although numerous genetic variants have been implicated, only a few of them have been replicated in subsequent studies. Four recent GWA studies have identified several novel risk alleles for breast cancer. All these studies, however, are conducted in women of European decent who differ from women of other ethnic groups in certain genetic architecture. Therefore, additional GWA studies, particularly those conducted in non-European decent population, are needed to fully uncover genetic basis for breast cancer susceptibility. Since 1996 we have initiated multiple population-based epidemiologic studies of cancer in Shanghai, China, including the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study (SBCS) (see Supplementary Methods). Included in Stages I to III of the current GWA study were genomic DNA samples from 6,531 incident breast cancer cases and 3,998 community controls who participated in these studies (Table 1). The pilot phase of the GWA study was initiated in 2005 with 150 cases and 150 controls genotyped using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 500K Array Set that contains approximately 500,000 SNPs. An additional 1,374 cases and 1,402 controls were genotyped in 2008 using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 that contains 906,602 SNPs. Cases and controls were matched on age. Included in the current analysis were 607,728 SNPs in the Affymetrix SNP array 6.0 and 330,885 SNPs in the Affymetrix 500K array set that met the following criteria: 1) >= 5% minor allele frequency (MAF), 2) >= 95% call rate, 3) >= 95% genotyping concordance rate in quality control (QC) samples, and additionally for SNPs in the Affymetrix 500K arrays only those that are also present in the Affymetrix 6.0 array (Supplementary Table S1). Of the initial 3,076 samples included in the GWA scan, 49 samples were excluded, due to < 95% call rate (n = 4), or sample duplication or contamination (n = 45). A total of 1,505 cases and 1,522 controls remained for the GWA analyses. Multidimensional scaling analyses based on pairwise identity-by-state showed no evidence of apparent genetic admixture in this study population (Supplementary Figure S1). Multiple genomic locations were revealed as potentially related to breast cancer risk (Figure 1), and the observed number of SNPs with a small P-value is larger than that expected by chance (Supplementary Figure S2). Similar results were obtained after excluding the 292 subjects genotyped by Affymetrix 500K Array Set from the analyses (data not shown). P-values presented in Figure 1 are derived from trend tests using logistic regression (df = 1) after adjusting for age. Six of the 11 SNPs identified from published GWA studies are included in the Affymetrix 6.0 array, and four of them showed an association with breast cancer risk consistent with that reported previously (Supplementary Table S2). Specifically, elevated risk of breast cancer was found to be associated with the minor allele of rs1219648 (FGFR2, Ptrend=0.0025), rs2981582 (FGFR2, Ptrend=0.001), rs3803662 (TNRC9, Ptrend=0.012), and rs8051542 (TNRC9, Ptrend=0.098). No apparent association, however, was found for rs3817198 (LSP1, Ptrend=0.75), and the association with rs2180341 (6q22.33, Ptrend=0.068) was in the opposite direction of the one reported initially in a study based on the Ashkenazi Jewish population. For our fast track replication, 29 most promising SNPs were genotyped in an independent set of 1,554 cases and 1,576 controls recruited in the SBCS. These SNPs were selected from those that had 1) MAF >= 10%; 2) very clear genotyping clusters; 3) not yet confirmed previously as a genetic risk variant for breast cancer; and 4) P <= 1 x 10-4 for all samples along with a consistent association at P <= 0.05 in samples analyzed in the first batch (754 cases/741 controls) and the second batch (751 cases/781 controls) or P <= 5 x 10-4 for all subjects and consistent association at P <= 0.01 in both batches. Of the 29 SNPs included in fast-track replication (Supplementary Table S3), four SNPs in stage II showed a significant association with breast cancer risk at P <= 0.05 and the fifth one had a P-value of 0.077 (Table 2). A highly significant association with breast cancer risk was identified for rs2046210 (P = 3.9 x 10-5) and rs10872676 (P = 1.6 x 10-3). Both SNPs are located at 6q25.1, approximately 4.4 kb apart, showing a high degree of LD (r2 = 0.69). Therefore, rs2046210 was selected for further validation, as rs10872676 showed a weaker association with breast cancer risk than rs2046210, and its association was not statistically significant after adjusting for rs2046210. Four SNPs were further evaluated in Stage III (Table 2), which included 3,472 cases who were recruited during 2002 and 2006 as part of the Shanghai Breast Cancer Survivor Study (SBCSS), along with 900 healthy women recruited from the same source population as the control group for a population-based endometrial cancer study that was conducted in parallel with the SBCS. Again, rs2046210 was associated with breast cancer risk (P = 3.3 x 10-7) (Table 2), and the P-value reached 2.0 x 10-15 in the pooled analysis of samples from all three stages (Table 3). This p-value is substantially lower than the genome-wide significance level based on conservative Bonferroni adjustment of multiple comparisons at a level alpha = 0.05, providing unequivocal evidence for an association of this SNP with breast cancer risk. This SNP was associated with a population attributable risk (PAR) of 18.9% and an estimated 2.1% excess familial risk of breast cancer. The positive association of this SNP with breast cancer risk was found for both pre- and post-menopausal women, and the association was stronger for ER negative cancer than ER positive cancer (P=0.02) (Table 3). None of the other three SNPs, however, were replicated in Stage III (Table 2). Figure 2 shows the 6q25.1 locus where rs2046210 is located. A cluster of SNPs that are in strong LD with rs2046210 all showed a significant association with breast cancer risk with P <= 0.001 in Stage I. Using data from Stage I, haplotype analyses of a haplotype block including rs2046210 and other 7 SNPs as defined by the method of Gabriel or a larger block including 7 additional SNPs failed to identify any particular SNP that may explain the observed association in this locus (Supplementary Table S4). We also evaluated SNP rs2046210 in association with breast cancer risk among 1,590 cases and 1,466 controls of European ancestry, recruited as part of the Nashville Breast Health Study (NBHS), a population based case-control study conducted in Tennessee, USA (Table 1). Consistent with the findings from the Shanghai studies, the variant allele of this SNP was associated with an elevated risk of breast cancer, and the association was stronger in post- than pre-menopausal women (Table 4). Several genes are located in the 1 Mb region centered on SNP rs2046210 including PLEKHG1, MTHFD1L, AKAP12, ZBTB2, RMND1, C6orf211, C6orf97, ESR1, C6orf98, SYNE1, and NANOGP11. Of them, the ESR1 gene is perhaps of particular interest to breast carcinogenesis. The ESR1 gene encodes estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) that regulates signal transduction of estrogen, a sex hormone that plays a central role in the etiology of breast cancer. Elevated estrogen levels have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in multiple prospective studies. Since biological effects of estrogen are mediated primarily through high-affinity binding to ERs, genetic variants in ER genes, including ESR1 and ESR2 have been the focus of multiple previous epidemiologic studies. The identified SNP (rs2046210) associated with breast cancer risk is located 29 kb upstream of the first untranslated exon and 180 kb upstream of the transcription start site of exon 1 of the ESR1 gene. None of the SNPs at this locus has been previously reported to be associated with breast cancer, nor in LD with two of the most widely studied polymorphisms in ESR1: rs2234693 and rs9340799 (r2<0.05 in both HapMap Asian and women of European decent samples). SNP rs2234693 was genotyped in Stage I of the study and carried an OR (95% CI) of 0.95 (0.80-1.12) for C/T and 0.79 (0.63-1.00) for T/T genotype in relation to breast cancer risk. Because of the relatively close location to the ESR1 gene and the biological function of ERalpha, it is possible that rs2046210 or SNPs in LD with it may alter ESR1 gene expression and affect susceptibility to breast cancer. It is noteworthy that a recent GWA study has found that the 6q25.1 locus is associated with bone mineral density, a phenotype that is affected by estrogen. SNP rs2046210 is located 6 kb downstream of C6orf97, the chromosome 6 open reading frame 97. The function of C6orf97 is unknown. The LD block that includes rs2046210 spans a region of about 41 kb (151,971,942 to 152,013,380) which contains part of C6orf97. By running BLAST with C6orf97 coding peptide as the query sequence, a structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) domain was found in the C-terminal of the C6orf97 protein. SMC proteins appear to play an important role in chromosome dynamics. Further research to the functionality of C6orf97 and its potential association with breast cancer may be warranted.

The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the Shanghai Cancer Institute, the Shanghai Center for Disease Prevention and Control, and Meharry Medical College. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Genotyping and quality control procedures For detailed descriptions of the genotyping and quality control procedures see Supplementary Materials. Briefly, in Stage I, the initial 300 subjects were genotyped using the Affymetrix GeneChip Mapping 500K Array Set and the remaining 2,776 samples were genotyped using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0. In each of the 96-well plates genotyped using the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array, three positive QC samples (NA15510, NA10851, and NA18505) purchased from Coriell Cell Repositories (http://ccr.coreill.org/), and a negative QC sample (water) were included. SNP data obtained from the positive QC samples showed a very high concordance rate of called genotypes based on 79,764,872 comparisons (mean, 99.87%; median, 100%). In addition, 742 SNPs were genotyped using the Affymetrix Target Genotyping System, TaqMan or Sequenom for a subset of subjects included in previous studies. A high concordance rate was also observed between genotypes determined using these platforms and Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 based on 1,478,383 comparisons (mean, 99.1%; median, 99.8%). Samples with genotyping call rates less than 95% were excluded, and the remaining samples were recalled by using Birdseed v2. The gender of all study samples was confirmed to be female. The identity-by-descent analysis based on identity-by-state was performed to detect first degree cryptic relationships using the PLINK 1.04 (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink/). A final data set included 3,027 individuals and 607,728 markers in the Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 and 330,885 in the Affymetrix 500K Array Set that met the following criteria: (1) genotype call rate >= 95%; (2) MAF >= 5%; and (3) genotyping concordance rate in QC samples >= 95%. Also excluded from the analyses were 21,223 SNPs that are on Affymetrix 500K Array Set but not on the SNP Array 6.0. Genotyping for the replication sets was completed using the iPLEXtm Sequenom MassArray  platform. Included in each 96-well plate as QC samples were two negative controls (water), two blinded duplicates, and two samples included in the HapMap project. The mean concordance rate was 99.7% for blind duplicates (2,572 comparisons) and 99.2% for HapMap samples (1,751 comparisons). Statistical analyses The PLINK version 1.04 was used to analyze genome-wide data obtained in Stage I. A set of 4,305 SNPs with MAF >= 0.35 and >= 100 kb between two adjacent SNPs was selected to evaluate the population structure. The inflation factor lambda was estimated to be 1.024, suggesting that population substructure, if present, should not have any appreciable effect on the results. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated from logistic regression analysis. Age was adjusted in the GWA analyses of Stage I data to select promising SNPs. Additional adjustment was made for education in the analyses of Stages II and III data. Finally, multivariate analyses including age, education, study stage, body mass index, age at menarche, and age at first live birth were performed in the pooled analyses of data from all stages. None of the 29 markers genotyped in Stage II showed deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P > 0.05). P-values based on 2-tailed tests are presented. Haplotype analyses methods: SNPs genotyped in Stage I in a region of ~100kb containing rs2046210 were used to reconstruct haplotypes. LD between SNPs was assessed by Haploview. Haplotype blocks were defined using the methods of Gabriel et al and 9 blocks were observed (Supplementary Figure S3). Block 5 includes rs2046210 and seven other SNPs, rs7740686, rs7763637, rs9397436, rs9397437, rs6908732, rs852004, and rs865898 (Supplementary Table S4). Associations of haplotypes with breast cancer risk were analyzed with HAPSTAT software based on additive models. Additional analyses were performed for haplotypes defined using SNPs included in blocks 4 and 5 with a total of 15 SNPs (Supplementary Figure S3, Supplementary Table S4). Imputation analysis: We used PLINK to impute genotypes for autosomal SNPs that were present in HapMap Phase II release 23a but not genotyped in our GWA scan. HapMap genotype data from the 90 Asian HapMap subjects that have MAF >= 1% and genotyping rate >= 95% were used as reference. During the imputation, an information score was generated for each imputed SNP that reflected how confidently genotypes were inferred. Values below 0.80 were taken to be indicative of poor quality and were not analyzed. Besides the 0.61 million observed SNPs, an additional 1.14 million imputed SNPs were tested for association with breast cancer.

35763030	ABSTRACT	Aims/hypothesis Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of kidney failure and has a substantial genetic component. Our aim was to identify novel genetic factors and genes contributing to DKD by performing meta-analysis of previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on DKD and by integrating the results with renal transcriptomics datasets. Methods We performed GWAS meta-analyses using ten phenotypic definitions of DKD, including nearly 27,000 individuals with diabetes. Meta-analysis results were integrated with estimated quantitative trait locus data from human glomerular (N=119) and tubular (N=121) samples to perform transcriptome-wide association study. We also performed gene aggregate tests to jointly test all available common genetic markers within a gene, and combined the results with various kidney omics datasets. Results The meta-analysis identified a novel intronic variant (rs72831309) in the TENM2 gene associated with a lower risk of the combined chronic kidney disease (eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) and DKD (microalbuminuria or worse) phenotype (p=9.8x10-9; although not withstanding correction for multiple testing, p>9.3x10-9). Gene-level analysis identified ten genes associated with DKD (COL20A1, DCLK1, EIF4E, PTPRN-RESP18, GPR158, INIP-SNX30, LSM14A and MFF; p<2.7x10-6). Integration of GWAS with human glomerular and tubular expression data demonstrated higher tubular AKIRIN2 gene expression in individuals with vs without DKD (p=1.1x10-6). The lead SNPs within six loci significantly altered DNA methylation of a nearby CpG site in kidneys (p<1.5x10-11). Expression of lead genes in kidney tubules or glomeruli correlated with relevant pathological phenotypes (e.g. TENM2 expression correlated positively with eGFR [p=1.6x10-8] and negatively with tubulointerstitial fibrosis [p=2.0x10-9], tubular DCLK1 expression correlated positively with fibrosis [p=7.4x10-16], and SNX30 expression correlated positively with eGFR [p=5.8x10-14] and negatively with fibrosis [p<2.0x10-16]). Conclusions/interpretation Altogether, the results point to novel genes contributing to the pathogenesis of DKD. Data availability The GWAS meta-analysis results can be accessed via the type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D, respectively) and Common Metabolic Diseases (CMD) Knowledge Portals, and downloaded on their respective download pages (https://t1d.hugeamp.org/downloads.html; https://t2d.hugeamp.org/downloads.html; https://hugeamp.org/downloads.html).

35763030	INTRO	Introduction Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney disease. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is associated with high cardiovascular risk and mortality and, consequently, both diabetes and kidney disease are leading causes of death worldwide. Both environmental and genetic factors have a major impact on the risk of developing DKD. Although more than 300 genetic loci have been associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the general population, these loci show limited effect in DKD, especially in individuals with type 1 diabetes. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have previously identified a handful of genetic loci for DKD at the genome-wide significance level (p<5x10-8). Recently, a meta-analysis of GWAS, including up to 19,406 individuals with type 1 diabetes from the Diabetic Nephropathy Collaborative Research Initiative (DNCRI), identified 16 loci. The strongest association was a common missense variant in the COL4A3 gene, which also showed evidence of association in individuals with type 2 diabetes. A GWAS meta-analysis from The SUrrogate markers for Micro- and Macrovascular hard endpoints for Innovative diabetes Tools (SUMMIT) consortium, including 6000 individuals with type 2 diabetes from five different studies, identified three loci for DKD, including UMOD and PRKAG2 previously identified in the general population. However, meta-analysis with SUMMIT type 1 diabetes studies (SUMMIT-1, N=5156) did not yield any genome-wide significant findings. To increase the power to detect novel genetic risk factors for DKD shared among diabetes subtypes, we aggregated all available data for DKD in individuals of European ancestry with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (N~27,000). Specifically, we performed GWAS meta-analyses on ten different DKD case-control definitions, meta-analysing summary statistics from DNCRI, SUMMIT-1 and SUMMIT type 2 diabetes studies (SUMMIT-2), followed by integration with diverse biological data to improve our understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms and clinical correlations (Fig. 1). 
35763030	FIG	Schematic illustration of the study design, from GWAS meta-analysis to integration with various omics data sets. GWAS meta-analysis for ten different phenotypic definitions of DKD included up to 26,785 individuals with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes from the previous DNCRI and SUMMIT GWAS meta-analyses. The TWAS integrated the GWAS meta-analysis results with kidney eQTL data for tubular and glomerular compartments, identifying genes with differential expression in DKD. The mQTL data identified SNPs associated with DNA methylation at CpG sites. Single nucleus Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (snATACseq) was informative of chromatin openness in various kidney cell types. The RegulomeDB is a database with extensive epigenetic annotation for SNPs. The promoter capture HiC (PCHiC) sequencing data identified sequence interaction with gene promoters, proposing target genes. Kidney transcriptomics provided data on gene expression in glomerular and tubular tissue in nephrectomy samples, or in Pima Indian biopsies, correlated with various renal variables. scRNAseq, single-cell RNA sequencing; T1D, type 1 diabetes; T2D, type 2 diabetes TENM2 gene rs72831309 is associated with CKD-DKD.

(a) The GWAS SNP effect sizes for association with severe DKD (normal AER vs macroalbuminuria or ESRD) are correlated with TWAS eQTL weights to predict AKIRIN2 expression, suggesting that elevated AKIRIN2 levels in tubules are associated with severe DKD (p=1.1x10-6). The eQTL data for 39 SNPs explained 5% of the variance in tubular AKIRIN2 expression (p=0.01). (b) AKIRIN2 expression is correlated with renal fibrosis.

Correlation with fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis (GlomScl) and eGFR were measured in the nephrectomy samples; correlations with p<2.2x10-4 (corrected for 29 genes, two tissues and four tests) are shown. For the biopsy data in Pima Indians, suggestive correlations with p<8.6x10-4 are shown (corrected only for 29 genes and two tissues), including fibrosis at first biopsy and change in the mesangial volume between the first and the second biopsies. Association with DKD (diabetic nephropathy) was queried in two data sets (Woroniecka et al and Ju et al), with p<4.3x10-4 or p<0.05 and fold change>1.5.

Correlations were calculated with LD score regression for the whole meta-analysis (any diabetes, purple), type 2 diabetes only (red), and type 1 diabetes only (blue). The first column (purple) indicates genetic correlation for the DKD phenotypes between individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (none significant). Only significant correlations (p<0.01) are shown.

35763030	METHODS	Methods For detailed methods, please refer to the electronic supplementary material (ESM) Methods. Participating studies and phenotype definitions A total of ten case-control definitions for DKD were included in DNCRI, based on either urinary AER (divided into controls with normal AER, and cases with microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria or end-stage renal disease [ESRD]), eGFR, or both, and harmonised to match and include all seven phenotypic definitions assessed in SUMMIT-1 and SUMMIT-2 analyses (ESM Table 1). All individuals (both cases and controls) had diabetes (either type 1 or type 2 diabetes). For three phenotypic comparisons not initially part of the SUMMIT analysis, GWAS and meta-analysis were performed with three SUMMIT-2 studies and the Scania Diabetes Registry type 1 diabetes cohort. Individuals from the Finnish Diabetic Nephropathy Study (FinnDiane) were included in both the original DNCRI (N=6019) and SUMMIT-1 analyses (N=3415) and thus were excluded here from the SUMMIT-1 data (ESM Table 2). All contributing studies were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Declaration of Istanbul. Genome-wide association study and meta-analysis Genotyping and statistical analysis of the DNCRI and SUMMIT cohorts have been previously described. Analysis plans were similar in the cohorts (ESM Table 3). Imputation was performed using 1000Genomes Phase 3 reference panel in DNCRI, and the older 1000Genomes Phase I panel in the SUMMIT cohorts. Analyses were performed in unrelated individuals using the SNPtest additive score test, adjusting for age, sex, diabetes duration, the genetic principal components, and study-specific covariates (e.g. site or genotyping batch). Variants were filtered for INFO imputation quality score >=0.3 (DNCRI) or >=0.4 (SUMMIT) and minor allele count >=10 in both cases and controls. In SUMMIT, variants were further filtered to those with minor allele frequency (MAF) >=0.01. Meta-analyses of DNCRI, SUMMIT-1 and SUMMIT-2 summary statistics were performed with inverse variance fixed effect methods based on the effect sizes. Variants were limited to those found in at least two studies. Power calculations indicated 80% power to detect associations with p<5x10-8 and an OR of 1.20 for the combined 'all vs ctrl' phenotype for common variants with MAF>=10%, or with an OR of 1.28 and 1.73 for low-frequency (MAF 5%) and rare (MAF 1%) variants, respectively (ESM Fig. 1). Correction for multiple testing was estimated with spectral decomposition of the ten DKD traits, suggesting 5.36 effective tests, leading to a corrected significance threshold of p<9.3x10-9. Gene prioritisation analysis Gene prioritisation at the top loci was performed using two complementary similarity-based gene prioritisation approaches (Polygenic Priority Score [PoPS] v0.1 and MAGMA v1.06b), which integrate GWAS with gene set enrichment based on a variety of biological annotation datasets. Gene-level analysis SNPs from the GWAS meta-analysis summary statistics were aggregated by gene-level regression analysis using two related programs, MAGMA v1.06b and PASCAL v2016, using default parameters. Gene-level significance thresholds were determined by a Bonferroni multiple testing correction based on the number of genes tested for each of the ten phenotypes (from p<2.7x10-6 to p<2.3x10-6). Transcriptome-wide association study In the transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS), MetaXcan was applied with default parameters to integrate GWAS meta-analysis results with kidney expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) datasets for micro-dissected human glomerular (N=119) and tubular (N=121) samples. Significance threshold of p<4.1x10-6 was determined by Bonferroni correction for two tissues and 6050 genes found in either tubular or glomerular eQTL data. Kidney eQTL, methylation quantitative trait loci, and colocalisation analysis Kidney-specific eQTL associations were queried for glomeruli, tubules, and a meta-analysis of four eQTL studies with 451 kidney samples. Kidney methylation quantitative trait locus (mQTL) associations were sought in 188 healthy kidney samples profiled by the Infinium MethylationEPIC Kit and BeadChips (Illumina, USA), with p<1.5x10-11 considered significant. For the significant CpG sites, we tested association with DKD in our epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of 1304 All Ireland-Warren 3-Genetics of Kidneys in Diabetes (GoKinD) United Kingdom (UK-ROI) collection and FinnDiane participants, analysed using the Infinium MethylationEPIC Kit and BeadChips, as previously described. To estimate posterior probability that the GWAS association colocalised with the kidney eQTL and mQTL signals, we performed Bayesian multiple-trait-colocalisation analysis, with posterior probability >0.8 considered evidence of colocalisation. Human kidney gene expression For the 29 lead genes, we studied gene expression in kidneys in human transcriptomics data from nephrectomy samples (433 tubule and 335 glomerulus samples) and kidney biopsies from the Pima Indian cohort (67 glomerular and 47 tubulointerstitial tissues), and tested for correlation with relevant pathological phenotypes. The micro-dissected nephrectomy samples were from individuals with varying degree of diabetic and hypertensive kidney disease, and gene expression was defined with RNA sequencing. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Pennsylvania. In the Pima Indian cohort, gene expression profiling in the first biopsy was performed with Affymetrix gene chip arrays, and with Illumina RNA sequencing for the second biopsy. Available phenotypes included progression to ESRD, measured GFR (mGFR), albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR), HbA1c and six kidney morphological variables for both biopsies, and change in the phenotypes between the first and the second study biopsies (27 phenotypes in total). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. Linkage disequilibrium score regression and Mendelian randomisation Linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression (LDSR) was performed at LDhub (http://ldsc.broadinstitute.org/, accessed 22 August 2019) between our 10 DKD GWAS and 78 glycaemic, autoimmune, anthropometric, bone, smoking behaviour, lipid, kidney, uric acid, cardiometabolic and ageing-related traits (ESM Table 4). LDSR associations with Bonferroni-adjusted p<6.4x10-4 were considered significant. To identify causal relationships for significant traits in the LDSR against DKD, we performed summary-based two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) with inverse variance-weighted regression implemented in TwoSampleMR v0.5.6 R package. Causality was further assessed using methods less sensitive to pleiotropy/heterogeneity.
35763030	RESULTS	Results GWAS meta-analysis The GWAS meta-analysis of the DNCRI (type 1 diabetes), and SUMMIT-1 and SUMMIT-2 meta-analyses included up to 26,785 individuals with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes from 25 studies; 11,380 individuals had any DKD (micro- or macroalbuminuria or ESRD) and 15,405 individuals had normal AER (ESM Table 2). QQ plots, lambda genomic control inflation factor (lambdaGC) and LDSR intercepts of the meta-analysis indicated no marked inflation or population stratification bias of the results (ESM Fig. 2). The meta-analysis identified a novel association between the combined CKD-DKD phenotype (cases with eGFR <45 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and microalbuminuria or worse, vs controls with normal AER and eGFR >=60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) and rs72831309 (MAF=4%; OR 2.08, p=9.8x10-9; Fig. 2a, Table 1 and ESM Table 5). Of note, the association was barely above the threshold after correction for multiple testing due to multiple phenotypes (p>9.3x10-9). We observed no heterogeneity between individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes (pHET=0.88). The variant is located in an intron of the TENM2 gene encoding the teneurin transmembrane protein 2. The variant was imputed with moderate imputation quality across cohorts (INFO score 0.38-0.66). In the FinnDiane cohort with the strongest statistical significance, the association remained (though slightly attenuated) after re-imputation with a population-specific panel (INFO=0.92, p=2.0x10-4, OR 1.70 [95% CI 1.28, 2.24] vs INFO=0.66, p=1.0x10-6, OR 2.27 [95% CI 1.64, 3.16]).  At the previously identified COL4A3 locus, we identified a secondary association peak (rs6436688, p=1.8x10-7 for severe DKD; ESM Fig. 3) in only partial LD (D'=0.51, r2=0.08) with the lead variant rs55703767. The association at rs6436688 remained nominally significant after conditional analysis for rs55703767 (p=0.002). In addition to the COL4A3 locus, nine other previously identified, mostly low-frequency or rare variants were associated with various kidney phenotypes (Table 1 and ESM Fig. 4). None of these variants were found in the SUMMIT meta-analyses (filtered to MAF>=1%), and thus, these associations represent the originally reported associations from the DNCRI. One common (chr14q12), and four of our previously identified rare DNCRI loci (TAMM41, HAND2-AS1, DDR1-VARS2, BMP7; MAF~1%) associated with microalbuminuria demonstrated attenuated association when combined with the SUMMIT meta-analyses (with the rare variants only found in SUMMIT-2). The lack of replication across diabetes subtypes suggest either false positives or a lack of power to detect an association for rare variants in individuals with type 2 diabetes DKD (a more heterogeneous disease, particularly for the early stages of DKD [i.e. microalbuminuria]). Alternatively, this could simply represent a lack of shared biology across diabetes subtypes, again possibly due to the different underlying causes of kidney damage in individuals with type 1 vs type 2 diabetes. Two variants, chr3:141792314:I and rs186434345, were associated with ESRD (N=940, p=4.6x10-10), and with the CKD-DKD phenotype (N=2571, p=4.0x10-8) in the SUMMIT-2 and SUMMIT-1 cohorts, but were absent in DNCRI. When the original SUMMIT-FinnDiane GWAS was included in the analysis, both associations were non-significant (chr3:141792314:I, p=0.056, N=3207; rs186434345, p=0.002, N=4782) and thus excluded from further consideration. Gene prioritisation To identify the underlying causal genes within each of our top loci, we used the PoPS method that leverages genome-wide enrichment of biological annotations in combination with GWAS summary statistics to prioritise candidate genes. To increase precision, we intersected the results with both the simple nearest-gene approach and MAGMA gene prioritisation. Four genes (COL4A3, PLEKHA7, CNTN6 and TENM2) were both the PoPS prioritised gene and the nearest protein coding gene to the lead SNP (Table 1). Of note, the CNTN6 locus contained only two protein coding genes and the TENM2 locus only one. When taking the intersect between PoPS genes and genes that were within MAGMA's top 10% of prioritised genes genome-wide, COL4A3 was the only prioritised gene (ESM Fig. 5). The gene set that prioritised COL4A3 for severe DKD was the fibulin 2 protein-protein interaction network ('FBLN2 PPI subnetwork'), which together with 26 correlated reconstituted gene-sets makes up the 'basement membrane' meta-gene set derived in Marouli et al (ESM Table 6). Gene-level analysis To improve power and jointly test all available common genetic markers within a gene, SNPs from the GWAS meta-analysis summary statistics were aggregated by gene and tested jointly for association using two similar programs, MAGMA and PASCAL. In addition to COL20A1 and SNX30 identified previously, we identified eight novel gene associations (p<2.7x10-6; Table 2 and ESM Fig. 6). The lead variants in these loci indicated no significant heterogeneity between type 1 and type 2 diabetes apart from the GPR158 locus (pHET=0.005; ESM Table 7). MAGMA's gene-level analysis type 1 error was well controlled, with all but one lambdaGC inflation factor under 1.05 (MAGMA's ESRD vs all lambdaGC=1.07). The genome-wide gene-level results from PASCAL showed slightly more inflation (lambdaGC up to 1.15 for ESRD vs all).  Integration of GWAS with kidney eQTL data We performed TWAS for each of the ten DKD meta-analyses to predict differential gene expression between cases and controls based on eQTL data in glomerular and tubulointerstitial samples from histologically normal kidneys. The type 1 error was well controlled (lambdaGC 0.968-1.097; ESM Fig. 7). Expression levels of AKIRIN2 were predicted to be higher in the tubular tissue of cases with severe DKD (or macroalbuminuria alone), as compared with controls with normal AER (p values 1.1x10-6 and 1.7x10-6, respectively; Fig. 3a and ESM Tables 8, 9).  Kidney eQTL and mQTL associations Kidney eQTL and mQTL data were queried for the top three variants at each lead locus from the GWAS meta-analyses and gene-level analyses. Kidney eQTL data suggested SNX30 as the target gene in the INIP-SNX30 region (rs786959 eQTL p=4.6x10-7), and the GWAS association colocalised with the eQTL signal with moderate evidence (posterior probability 0.70; ESM Table 10). Altogether, 17 variants were significantly associated with kidney DNA methylation levels at six CpG sites (p<1.5x10-11; ESM Table 11), of which the mQTL colocalised with the GWAS association in LSM14A, DCLK1 and COL20A1 (posterior probability for colocalisation >0.80). SNPs in the LSM14A gene were associated with severe DKD and cg14143166 methylation levels (p=1.9x10-28). Interestingly, cg14143166 methylation in blood was nominally associated with DKD status in our EWAS in the UK-ROI and FinnDiane cohorts (p=0.03), suggesting that the DKD association at LSM14A is mediated through methylation changes. Similarly, blood methylation levels at significant kidney mQTL CpG sites (rs7664964-cg25974308 p=1.1x10-11) in EIF4E were nominally associated with eGFR slope in diabetes (p=0.04). Gene expression and pathological phenotypes Altogether, we identified 29 lead genes or transcripts from GWAS, gene prioritisation, gene-level analyses, kidney eQTL data or TWAS. Among these, the expression levels of 14 genes significantly correlated with eGFR, glomerulosclerosis or fibrosis in transcriptomics data obtained from 433 tubular and 335 glomerular nephrectomy samples with varying degree of diabetic and hypertensive kidney disease (p<2.2x10-4; Fig. 4 and ESM Table 12). For example, tubular TENM2 expression correlated positively with eGFR (p=1.6x10-8; Fig. 2e) and negatively with tubulointerstitial fibrosis (p=2.0x10-9; Fig. 2f), tubular DCLK1 expression correlated positively with fibrosis (p=7.4x10-16; Fig. 7c), and tubular SNX30 expression correlated positively with eGFR (p=5.8x10-14) and negatively with fibrosis (p<2.0x10-16). In the Pima Indian kidney biopsy data, tubular DCLK1 expression was suggestively correlated (p<8.6x10-4, corrected for 29 genes and two tissues) with higher level of fibrosis, and LSM14A negatively correlated with the change in mesangial volume between the two study biopsies (non-significant after further conservative correction for 27 tested phenotypes). Multiple genes were nominally (p<0.05) correlated with these renal variables (ESM Fig. 8, ESM Table 13).  Genetic correlation of DKD between type 1 and type 2 diabetes and general population kidney traits We performed LDSR to study the genetic correlation of DKD traits between individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes but, likely due to limited sample size, no significant correlations were observed. When compared with the kidney traits from the CKDgen consortium, the 'All vs Ctrl' phenotype was correlated with microalbuminuria in the general population and ACR in diabetes, both in the main meta-analysis and for type 1 and type 2 diabetes separately (p<0.01). In addition, microalbuminuria in type 2 diabetes was correlated with microalbuminuria in the general population, and CKD in type 2 diabetes was positively correlated with CKD in the general population and negatively with eGFR in the general population; these were not significantly correlated in individuals with type 1 diabetes despite a larger number of samples (Fig. 5).  Genetic correlation and MR with related traits LDSR of related metabolic traits revealed significant genetic correlation (p<6.4x10-4) between DKD and 15 traits including multiple obesity-related traits, mother's age at death, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, HDL-cholesterol, urate, and two smoking-related traits (Fig. 6 and ESM Fig. 9). MR of these traits suggested that being overweight or obese was a causal risk factor for DKD (Fig. 6b and ESM Table 14). The causal effects were directionally consistent across methods, with no evidence of heterogeneity (I2=0-42.9%, p>0.05; ESM Table 14) or unbalanced horizontal pleiotropy (ESM Table 15). The MR Egger method, more robust for pleiotropic effects, further supported a causal role for higher BMI, waist circumference and hip circumference in DKD risk (p<0.05; ESM Table 14, ESM Fig. 10).

35763030	DISCUSS	Discussion We have performed the largest GWAS meta-analysis to date on kidney complications in diabetes, including ten different phenotypic definitions in up to 26,785 individuals with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, and integrated the results with emerging kidney omics data (Fig. 1). In the single-variant analysis with the combined CKD-DKD phenotype, we identified one novel locus, rs72831309, intronic in TENM2. TENM2 encodes the teneurin transmembrane protein 2 involved in cell-cell adhesion. The variant rs72831309 alters a predicted CREB1 transcription factor binding site (Fig. 2c), and is nominally associated with expression of a TENM2 antisense transcript TENM2-AS1 in kidneys (p=0.007; ESM Table 10). Furthermore, chromatin conformation data in the GM12878 cell line indicated that the rs72831309 region interacts with the TENM2 transcription start site, as well as with three antisense transcripts (CTB-180C19.1 [Ensembl ENSG00000254365], CTB-105L4.2 [Ensembl ENSG00000253527] and CTB-78F1.1 [Ensembl ENSG00000254187]) within the TENM2 gene. Whereby kidney single-cell RNA sequencing indicated TENM2 expression particularly in podocytes (Fig. 2d), lower tubular TENM2 expression was associated with renal fibrosis (p=2.0x10-9) and lower eGFR (p=1.6x10-8) in the nephrectomy samples. Despite multiple supporting lines of evidence, the locus still needs further validation as the imputation quality of rs72831309 was on the low end across our cohorts (0.38-0.66), and the association did not remain significant after correction for multiple testing (p>9.3x10-9). Gene-level analysis identified ten genes associated with DKD. The DCLK1 gene encodes a doublecortin-like kinase. The histone modification-based ChromHMM 15-state model for fetal kidney indicated strong transcription overlapping one of the three lead SNPs in the DCLK1 locus (rs61948262), and ChIP-seq data supported ZSCAN4 binding to the locus in the HEK293 kidney epithelial cell line. In addition, the lead SNPs were kidney mQTLs for DCLK1 CpG sites (p=6.8x10-22). Furthermore, multiple lines of evidence highlight the importance of DCLK1 in DKD. The correlation between tubular DCLK1 expression and fibrosis was among the strongest correlations both in the nephrectomy samples (p=7.4x10-16; Fig. 7) and in the Pima Indian biopsies (p=3.0x10-4), and glomerular DCLK1 expression was nominally associated with glomerular width, mesangial volume and podocyte foot process width in the Pima Indian biopsies (p<0.05; ESM Table 13). Furthermore, both glomerular and tubular DCLK1 expression were elevated in DKD in two additional datasets (fold change 1.98, p=1.2x10-4 for glomeruli; fold change 2.09, p=0.003 for tubules; Fig. 7). Finally, we previously identified a subset of transcripts, including DCLK1, targeted by the early growth response-1 transcription factor in a murine model of DKD. In that study, Dclk1 expression was upregulated in diabetic vs non-diabetic Apoe-/- mouse kidneys. Taken together, these expression data in human and experimental DKD identify DCLK1 as a novel target.  Kidney eQTL data for the top SNPs in the INIP-SNX30 locus pointed towards SNX30, encoding the sorting nexin family member 30, with the DKD risk-associated rs786959 A allele associated with higher SNX30 expression (p=4.6x10-7). On the contrary, in our transcriptomics data higher tubular SNX30 was correlated with higher eGFR (p=5.8x10-14) and lower level of fibrosis (p<2.0x10-16); glomerular expression was correlated with less glomerulosclerosis (p=8.0x10-5). Finally, kidney SNX30 expression was associated with higher eGFR in the general population using TWAS based on kidney tubular eQTL and GWAS on eGFR (p=0.046; ESM Table 8). The TWAS analysis based on our GWAS results, integrated with micro-dissected tubular and glomerular eQTL data, predicted that AKIRIN2 gene expression is elevated in tubules in individuals with severe DKD compared with individuals with normal AER (p=1.1x10-6). AKIRIN2 gene expression was highly correlated with the level of fibrosis (p=2.8x10-7). AKIRIN2 encodes a conserved nuclear factor that is a downstream effector of the toll-like receptor, TNF and IL-1beta signalling pathways, involved in stimulating proinflammatory pathways. This factor binds to nuclear NF-kappaB complexes and is required for the transcription of a subset of NF-kappaB-dependent genes such as IL6, CXCL10 and CCL5; NF-kappaB activation drives inflammatory responses and is activated in DKD. The strongest regulatory evidence in RegulomeDB was obtained for rs1260634 intronic in the LSM14A gene: rs1260634 exerts strong transcription in 125 tissues including fetal kidney chromatin state model, is located in a ZNF362 binding sequence in HEK293 cell line, and affects a predicted transcription factor binding motif for Kruppel-like factors 4 and 12 (KLF4 and KLF12) and Sp8 transcription factor (ESM Fig. 11). Furthermore, in our kidney mQTL data, rs1260634 showed strong association (p=2.1x10-28) with cg14143166, where methylation in blood was associated with DKD in our EWAS data (p=0.03). Tubular LSM14A expression correlated with higher eGFR (p=2.9x10-6), and glomerular expression with the decrease in mesangial volume (p=6.5x10-4; significant after correction for 29 tested genes and two tissues, but not for 27 phenotypes). LSM14A encodes an Sm-like protein, thought to participate in pre-mRNA splicing, and implicated in innate antiviral responses. Other noteworthy novel genes include EIF4E and PTPRN. EIF4E encodes a common mRNA translation initiation factor; its activation and/or suppression are influenced by mTOR signalling cascades involved in DKD as well as high glucose and high insulin environments in renal epithelial cells. PTPRN encodes islet antigen 2 (IA-2), a major type 1 diabetes autoantigen involved in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In mice, IA-2 is required to maintain normal levels of renin expression in kidneys. Finally, the MFF gene identified in our gene-level analysis has been previously related to DKD. However, the association may be driven by the neighbouring COL4A3 association, as suggested previously. Indeed, one limitation of our gene-level analysis is the inability to confidently assign genes to a given set of correlated SNPs within a region. While it is reasonable to prioritise the gene in which the SNPs lie, it remains possible that extended LD patterns are tagging other nearby genes. Similarly, assigning a causal gene for the lead SNPs is not straightforward. We have utilised the eQTL and other data when available but also used a simple nearest-gene approach to name the associated region. In the transcriptomics analyses, as expected, all 13 significant correlations with the level of fibrosis were observed for tubular gene expression, and the two observed correlations for glomerulosclerosis were for glomerular expression of SNX30 and COLEC11 (Fig. 4). Interestingly, eight out of ten correlations with eGFR were obtained for tubular rather than glomerular gene expression, supporting the importance of tubular damage in the loss of renal function. While there is a strong epidemiological link between DKD and coronary artery disease in diabetes, our LDSR is the first study to report a genetic correlation between these major diabetic complications. Among the lipid traits, significant correlation with DKD was found only for lower HDL-cholesterol, despite previous MR of kidney disease in the general population implicating HDL as a marker of dyslipidaemia rather than a causal factor. Indeed, our subsequent MR found no evidence of causality between HDL and DKD; in concordance with our previous MR on BMI, only obesity-related traits were causal risk factors for DKD. However, we cannot exclude that the associations detected in our studies might partly reflect collider bias. Of note, our current MR was in line with our previous MR in type 1 diabetes suggesting that serum urate levels are not a causal risk factor for DKD; similar negative results were also reported for non-diabetic CKD. Most kidney disease in individuals with type 1 diabetes is considered to occur due to diabetic nephropathy, histologically characterised by thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and mesangial expansion, as well as renal tubular, interstitial and arteriolar lesions. In individuals with type 2 diabetes, only a proportion of DKD is purely due to diabetic nephropathy, whereas ageing, obesity and hypertension also contribute to kidney decline. These differences were also seen in our genetic correlation analysis, with CKD in type 2 diabetes genetically resembling CKD and eGFR in the general population, and no significant correlation observed in individuals with type 1 diabetes. Thus, including individuals with type 2 diabetes in the meta-analysis increases the heterogeneity of the underlying disease. However, as type 2 diabetes represents 95% of all diabetes cases, including those individuals increases statistical power for our current work and future GWAS meta-analyses integrating multiple subtypes of diabetes to identify shared genetic risk factors for DKD.

34407845	TITLE	Association of germline genetic variants with breast cancer-specific survival in patient subgroups defined by clinic-pathological variables related to tumor biology and type of systemic treatment
34407845	ABSTRACT	Background Given the high heterogeneity among breast tumors, associations between common germline genetic variants and survival that may exist within specific subgroups could go undetected in an unstratified set of breast cancer patients. Methods We performed genome-wide association analyses within 15 subgroups of breast cancer patients based on prognostic factors, including hormone receptors, tumor grade, age, and type of systemic treatment. Analyses were based on 91,686 female patients of European ancestry from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium, including 7531 breast cancer-specific deaths over a median follow-up of 8.1 years. Cox regression was used to assess associations of common germline variants with 15-year and 5-year breast cancer-specific survival. We assessed the probability of these associations being true positives via the Bayesian false discovery probability (BFDP < 0.15). Results Evidence of associations with breast cancer-specific survival was observed in three patient subgroups, with variant rs5934618 in patients with grade 3 tumors (15-year-hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] 1.32 [1.20, 1.45], P = 1.4E-08, BFDP = 0.01, per G allele); variant rs4679741 in patients with ER-positive tumors treated with endocrine therapy (15-year-HR [95% CI] 1.18 [1.11, 1.26], P = 1.6E-07, BFDP = 0.09, per G allele); variants rs1106333 (15-year-HR [95% CI] 1.68 [1.39,2.03], P = 5.6E-08, BFDP = 0.12, per A allele) and rs78754389 (5-year-HR [95% CI] 1.79 [1.46,2.20], P = 1.7E-08, BFDP = 0.07, per A allele), in patients with ER-negative tumors treated with chemotherapy. Conclusions We found evidence of four loci associated with breast cancer-specific survival within three patient subgroups. There was limited evidence for the existence of associations in other patient subgroups. However, the power for many subgroups is limited due to the low number of events. Even so, our results suggest that the impact of common germline genetic variants on breast cancer-specific survival might be limited.

34407845	INTRO	Introduction Inherited common genetic variation is likely to influence survival in breast cancer patients. Results from pre-clinical experiments have shown different metastatic behaviors in mice with different genetic backgrounds. In addition, familial studies of breast cancer patients have shown that women with a first-degree relative with a poor prognosis breast cancer have a worse prognosis compared to women with a first-degree relative with a good prognosis cancer. Moreover, genome-wide and candidate gene association studies have discovered common genetic variants associated with specific subtypes of breast cancer based on the expression of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and the amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which are known breast cancer prognostic factors. Finally, a number of studies have suggested that specific common germline genetic variants affect breast cancer prognosis both overall and within subgroups of patients. Despite the supporting evidence, it remains challenging to identify common germline variants associated with breast cancer-specific survival. This may partially be explained by the good prognosis of breast cancer patients, which leads to underpowered analyses. Even large studies based on worldwide consortia cannot reach the number of breast cancer deaths necessary to detect small to moderate associations at a genome-wide significant level. However, breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and it is possible that stronger associations between common germline variants and breast cancer-specific survival are present in certain patient subgroups, but cannot be detected in breast cancer overall. Previous studies provide modest evidence supporting this hypothesis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the evidence for associations of inherited common genetic variants with breast cancer-specific survival within more homogeneous subgroups of breast cancer patients, defined by prognostic factors representative of tumor biology and/or by the type of systemic treatment. To this end, we performed genome-wide association analyses within clinically relevant, defined subgroups of patients based on hormone receptors, tumor grade, age at diagnosis, and type of systemic treatment. We also explored the subgroup-specific associations identified by previous studies, to confirm or refute those results.
34407845	METHODS	"Materials and methods Study sample We selected female breast cancer patients of European ancestry from studies participating in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). We included patients with available information about vital status and number of years from diagnosis to last follow-up who were diagnosed with a primary invasive breast cancer of any stage and were at least 18 years old at diagnosis. The final study sample consisted of 91,686 breast cancer patients from 70 BCAC studies. A description of the included studies is given in Additional file 1: Supplementary Table S1. Information about histopathology, survival, and treatment was collected by individual studies and pooled and harmonized at the Netherlands Cancer Institute before incorporation into the BCAC database at the University of Cambridge (version 12, July 2019). All studies were approved by the relevant ethics committees and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Patient subgroups The subgroups of interest were defined based on age at diagnosis, estrogen receptor (ER) status, progesterone receptor (PR) status, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, tumor grade, and the use and type of systemic treatment, as available in the BCAC database. For age at diagnosis and tumor grade, we focused on subgroups characterized by worse prognosis. We thus defined 15 subgroups: (a) patients younger than age 40 years at diagnosis; (b) patients with grade 3 tumors; (c) patients with ER-positive (ER+) tumors, who received endocrine therapy (any kind); (d) patients diagnosed with ER-negative (ER-) tumors, who received chemotherapy (any kind); (e) patients with tumors that were hormone receptor (HR) positive (ER+ or PR+) and HER2-negative (HER2-); (f) patients with HR-positive (HR+), HER2- tumors, who received chemotherapy (any kind); (g) patients with HR+, HER2- tumors, who did not receive chemotherapy; (h) patients with HR+, HER2-positive (HER2+) tumors; (i) patients with HR-negative (HR-), HER2+ tumors, (j) patients with HR-, HER2- tumors; (k) patients who received Tamoxifen; (l) patients who received an aromatase inhibitor; (m) patients who received a Cyclophosphamide Methotrexate Fluorouracil (CMF)-like chemotherapy regimen; (n) patients who received taxanes; (o) patients who received anthracyclines. The rationale and references to the literature supporting the choice of each subgroup for inclusion in a genome-wide association study on survival are given in Additional file 1: Supplementary Table S2. We did not include the subgroup of HER2+ tumors treated with Trastuzumab because of a relatively small number of patients and low event rate, leading to analyses that are more underpowered than those presented. Patients with metastatic breast tumors at diagnosis (1.1 % of all included patients) were excluded from the subgroup analyses whose definition was based on the use and type of systemic therapy as generally they are treated with palliative intent. In addition to the subgroup analyses, we also performed a genome-wide analysis of 15-year breast cancer-specific survival in all breast cancer patients. We performed this analysis to evaluate whether associations between common germline variants and breast cancer-specific survival in subgroups could be detected in the full dataset of patients. Genome-wide analyses for survival (unstratified by subtype) were previously performed based on 12 GWAS datasets, but these included fewer patients from iCOGS and OncoArray (n = 84,757), with shorter follow-up, than were available in the current dataset. We focused our analyses on the iCOGS and OncoArray datasets, because the remaining 10 GWAS datasets used in the previous study did not include information about tumor characteristics, beyond ER status, or treatment, which were crucial for the subgroup analyses. Due to the presence of missing values in the variables used to define the subgroups, not all patients could be classified by each subgroup. The number of patients included in each subgroup, together with the number of breast cancer-specific deaths, patient/tumor characteristics, treatment, and follow-up information, are shown in Additional file 1: Supplementary Tables S3-S4, and Additional file 2: Supplementary Table S5. Imputation of missing values in clinical and pathological variables For secondary adjusted analyses, we imputed missing values in the clinical and pathological variables using the Multiple imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) R package (v. 3.2.0), as described in Additional file 2: Supplementary Methods. A list of imputed variables and corresponding percentages of missing values and imputation methods is provided in Additional file 2: Supplementary Table S6. Genotyping and imputation of genetic variants, ancestry analysis, and quality controls Methods related to genotyping and genotype imputation have been described previously. In brief, patients were genotyped with two different arrays: iCOGS and OncoArray. Only samples that were inferred to have European ancestry, based on genotype data, were included in the analyses. Non-genotyped variants were initially imputed based on the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 (October 2014) release as reference panel. More recently, non-genotyped single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were re-imputed using a reference panel from the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) in order to improve imputation quality, especially for rarer variants. Analyses were performed on genotyped variants or imputed variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.01. Imputed variants were included in the analyses if they had imputation r2 > 0.7. Approximately 10 million variants were analyzed. Statistical analyses The outcome in the analyses was breast cancer-specific survival (time to death due to breast cancer). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using delayed entry Cox regression models, where the time at risk was considered as starting from the time of study entry if the study entry was after diagnosis (22.9% within 1 year after diagnosis, and 27.3% more than 1 year after diagnosis) and from diagnosis if the time of study entry was missing (24.5%), at diagnosis (16.9%) or before diagnosis (8.4%). The time-to-event was right censored at the time of last follow-up, or at 15 years after diagnosis, whichever came first. Patients who died of unknown cause or causes other than breast cancer were censored at the time of death if death occurred before 15 years from diagnosis or at 15 years otherwise. With reference to the results of Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG), we additionally performed analyses within the subgroups whose definition was based on the use and type of systemic therapy, where we restricted the maximum follow-up time to 5 years after diagnosis (Additional file 2: Supplementary Table S5). The goal of those analyses was to investigate the potential short-term effects of germline variants on patients who received specific types of systemic treatment, since the effect might not be constant over time and treatment plans tend to focus on the first 5 years after diagnosis. Cox regression analysis was performed within each subgroup of interest, separately, and was stratified by country. All the analyses were performed separately by genotyping platform (iCOGS vs OncoArray), and the results were combined via a fixed-effects meta-analysis. The standard errors of the HR estimates were re-computed based on the likelihood ratio test statistic, as done previously (Figs. 1 and 2). For variants that satisfied the inclusion criteria (MAF>0.01 and r2 > 0.7) on only one genotyping platform, we included the result for that specific platform (Tables 1 and 2). However, for variants with an association P < 5E-08, we also computed HR and 95% confidence interval in the other genotyping platform to verify that the direction of the association was the same (Additional file 2: Supplementary Table S7).  Inflation of the likelihood ratio test statistics was estimated, within each subgroup, by dividing the median of the observed test statistics values by the median of a  distribution (Additional file 2: Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). To assess the noteworthiness of the observed associations, we made use of the Bayesian false discovery probability (BFDP) measure. To compute BFDPs, we set the prior probability of true association to 10-4, as done previously, and chose the prior distribution of the log hazard ratio of interest (effect size of a variant) to be a Normal distribution with mean 0 and standard error equal to 0.2. We describe associations with BFDP < 0.15 as ""noteworthy"". For each noteworthy result at a prior of 10-4, we also provided BFDPs under two, more restrictive, prior probabilities of true association (10-5 and 10-6; Additional file 3: Supplementary Tables S8-S9). In addition, we estimated the power to detect genetic variant associated with 15-year and 5-year breast cancer-specific survival by subgroup (Additional file 3: Supplementary Table S10 and S11) as described in Additional file 2: Supplementary Methods. For each genome-wide significant (P < 5E-08) and/or noteworthy (BFDP < 0.15) association observed in the primary unadjusted subgroup analyses, we performed secondary analyses adjusted for age at diagnosis, tumor characteristics, and type of systemic treatment not used in the definition of the specific subgroup in which the association was detected (Tables 1 and 2). Secondary adjusted analyses were performed to account for residual heterogeneity; we used imputed covariates in order to keep the same sample size. For each genome-wide significant or noteworthy association in the primary unadjusted analyses, we looked at the functional annotation of the surrounding genomic area, using the Functional Mapping and Annotation of Genome-Wide Association Studies (FUMA GWAS) tool (Additional file 2: Supplementary Figures S5 and S6). We also tested whether the expression of the nearest genes correlated with distant metastasis-free survival in breast cancer patients using KMplotter. PancanQTL was used to identify cis-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTLs), trans-eQTLs, and survival eQTLs in breast cancer to see whether the genome-wide significant or noteworthy genetic variants from the primary analyses could be linked with the expression levels of genes affecting survival. In addition, for all the genome-wide significant and/or noteworthy associations detected in the primary analyses, we searched the GWAS catalog to see whether there was already evidence of those being associated with breast cancer or other traits.

34407845	RESULTS	Results After a median follow-up of 8.1 years, there were a total of 7531 breast cancer deaths among 91686 breast cancer patients (Additional file 1: Supplementary Tables S3-S4 and Additional file 2: Supplementary Table S5). In the 15-year breast cancer-specific survival analyses, power for detecting genome-wide significant associations was < 0.45 for effect sizes (HRs) < 1.20 in all subgroups investigated and for all minor allele frequencies. The power was highest in the subgroups of grade 3 tumors, ER+ tumors treated with endocrine therapy, HR+ and HER2- tumors, and patients who received tamoxifen (Additional file 3: Supplementary Table S10). In the 5-year breast cancer-specific survival analyses, power was highest in the subgroups of patients with an ER- tumor who received chemotherapy, patients who received tamoxifen, and patients who received anthracyclines (Additional file 3: Supplementary Table S11). Genome-wide significant and/or noteworthy associations with 15-year or 5-year breast cancer-specific survival were observed in the unadjusted analyses based on all patients (Additional file 2: Supplementary Table S7) and analyses of eight out of the 15 subgroups investigated (Tables 1 and 2; Figs. 1 and 2). The genomic inflation factor of the unadjusted genome-wide analyses varied from 0.981 to 1.028 (Additional file 2: Supplementary Figures S1- S4); it is therefore unlikely that the association results were affected by cryptic population substructure. Two genome-wide significant associations were observed in the unstratified analysis based on patients genotyped using OncoArray (Additional file 2: Supplementary Table S7), namely variants rs57714252 (P = 4.7E-08) and rs4129285 (P = 4.9E-08), both situated in an intergenic region of chromosome 4 (Additional file 2: Supplementary Figure S5). These results were only based on the OncoArray data, since on iCOGS the variants did not satisfy the inclusion criteria for genotypes (iCOGS imputation r2 = 0.62). The corresponding estimates in the iCOGS data were in the opposite direction compared to the OncoArray estimates, and the results from the meta-analysis were not genome-wide significant and showed a large BFDP (Additional file 2: Supplementary Table S7). Genome-wide significant associations were observed in the analysis restricted to patients diagnosed with a grade 3 tumor, with five correlated variants (Tables 1 and 2) located on chromosome X (Additional file 2: Supplementary Figure S5) in intron 1 of TBL1X. For the most significant variant, rs5934618, the alternative G allele was associated with increased risk of breast cancer death in unadjusted analyses (meta-analysis hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] 1.32 [1.20, 1.45], P = 1.4E-08, BFDP = 0.01; Table 2). The meta-analysis result remained substantially unchanged after adjusting for age at diagnosis, additional tumor characteristics, and treatment with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy (HR [95% CI] 1.31 [1.18, 1.44], P = 7.9E-08, BFDP = 0.05; Table 2). The variant was not associated with the outcome in lower-grade tumors or in all patients combined (heterogeneity by grade P = 1.5E-03; Additional file 2: Supplementary Figure S7). All the five variants overlap chromatin features H3K4me3 and H3K27ac (associated with active transcription start sites) in multiple mammary cell types from normal breast tissue (Additional file 2: Supplementary Figure S8). Furthermore, there was evidence of TBL1X expression being associated with distant metastasis-free survival (HR [95%CI] for high vs low expression 1.71 [1.20,2.44], P = 2.7E-03) specifically in grade 3 patients, but not in patients with lower-grade disease (Additional file 2: Supplementary Figure S9). However, there was no evidence of association with TBL1X expression in normal breast tissue with any of the variants identified in our genome-wide analyses (Additional file 2: Supplementary Figure S10). In the same subgroup of grade 3 tumors, we observed a noteworthy, non-genome-wide significant association with variant rs66871326, located on chromosome 2 in an intron of C2orf80. For variant rs66871326, the alternative A allele was associated with decreased risk of breast cancer death (HR [95% CI] 0.85 [0.80,0.90], P = 2.1E-07, BFDP = 0.11). The corresponding BFDP increased to 0.49 after adjusting for age at diagnosis, additional tumor characteristics, and treatment with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy (Table 1). We identified six variants on chromosome 15 with genome-wide significant associations within the subgroup of patients diagnosed with an ER+ or PR+, HER2- tumor (Table 1). We identified two independent variants, namely rs8030394 and rs112813972, both situated in an intronic region of THSD4 (Additional file 2: Supplementary Figure S5). For the most significant variant, rs8030394, the T allele was associated with increased risk of breast cancer death (HR [95% CI]: 2.47 [1.81, 3.37], P = 1.1E-08, BFDP = 0.42). For the second variant, rs112813972, the C allele was associated with decreased risk of death (HR [95% CI] 0.40 [0.28,0.55], P = 4.0E-08, BFDP = 0.70). These associations were not genome-wide significant after adjusting for age at diagnosis, additional tumor characteristics, and treatment with (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy, and the corresponding BFDPs increased to 0.72 and 0.90, respectively (Table 1). We observed genome-wide significant associations from the 15-year breast cancer-specific analyses in the subgroups of patients with an ER+ or PR+ and HER2- tumor who did and did not receive chemotherapy. Three correlated variants on chromosome 2 were identified within the subgroup of patients who received chemotherapy. The most significant variant, rs62192052, is located in an intronic region of DNER (Additional file 2: Supplementary Figure S5) and was associated with decreased risk of death (HR [95% CI] 0.15 [0.08, 0.28], P = 2.6E-09, per T allele; Table 1). Although the result remained genome-wide significant after adjusting for age at diagnosis and additional tumor characteristics, the BFDP from both the unadjusted and adjusted analysis was >= 0.99 (Table 1; Supplementary Table S8), indicating that this association is almost certainly a false positive. Variant rs56248395, located on chromosome 11 in an intron of NAV2 (Additional file 2: Supplementary Figure S5), was associated with breast cancer death in the subgroup of patients with an ER+ or PR+ and HER2- tumor who did not receive chemotherapy (HR [95% CI] 2.33 [1.72,3.15], P = 4.8E-08, per T allele; Table 1). This result had BFDP >= 0.59 and was only based on the OncoArray data, since on iCOGS the variants did not satisfy the inclusion criteria for genotypes (iCOGS imputation r2 = 0.66; Additional file 2: Supplementary Table S7). The corresponding estimates in the iCOGS data (HR [95% CI] 1.07 [0.80,1.41], P = 6.6E-01; Additional file 2: Supplementary Table S7) and from the meta-analysis (HR [95% CI] 1.53 [1.25,1.89], P = 5.2E-05; Table 2) were not genome-wide significant and not noteworthy (meta-analysis BFDP>=0.97; Table 2; Supplementary Table S9). We observed three additional single SNP noteworthy associations from the 15-year breast cancer-specific survival analyses. The intergenic variant rs4679741 on chromosome 3 was associated with breast cancer death in the subgroup of patients with an ER+ tumor treated with endocrine therapy (HR [95% CI] 1.18 [1.11, 1.26], P = 1.6E-07, BFDP = 0.09, per G allele). This result became genome-wide significant after adjusting for age at diagnosis, tumor characteristics, and treatment with chemotherapy (HR [95% CI] 1.20 [1.13, 1.28], P = 1.1E-08, BFDP = 0.01). The BFDP of this association remained < 0.15 when considering 10-5 as prior probability of true association (Additional file 3: Supplementary Table S8). PanCanQTL did not show any cis-eQTLs, trans-eQTLs nor survival eQTLs for this variant. Variant rs1106333 on chromosome 3, whose nearest gene is GRIP2, was associated with risk of dying of breast cancer in the subgroup of patients with an ER- tumor who received chemotherapy (HR [95% CI] 1.68 [1.39,2.03], P = 5.6E-08, BFDP = 0.12 per A allele). This result also became genome-wide significant after adjusting for additional prognostic factors (HR [95% CI] 1.70 [1.41,2.05], P = 4.4E-08, BFDP = 0.11). PanCanGTL revealed the presence of a cis-eQTL linking variant rs1106333 with GRIP2 expression in prostate adenocarcinoma but not in breast cancer. There was no evidence of association of GRIP2 expression levels with distant metastasis-free survival within ER- breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy based on KMPlotter data (Additional file 2: Supplementary Figure S11). The last association of interest was observed in the subgroup of patients who received anthracyclines with intergenic variant rs34072391 on chromosome 7, but was not noteworthy after adjustment for additional prognostic factors (Table 1). In the 5-year survival analyses focused on the treatment subgroups, we observed two genome-wide significant associations within the subgroup of patients diagnosed with an ER- tumor who received chemotherapy. The most significant variant was rs78754389, located on chromosome 4 in an intronic region of gene ARAP2 (Additional file 2: Supplementary Figure S5; HR [95% CI] 1.79 [1.46,2.20], P = 1.7E-08, BFDP = 0.07 per A allele). This result remained both genome-wide significant and noteworthy after adjusting for age at diagnosis and additional tumor characteristics (HR [95% CI] 1.67 [1.39,2.00], P = 4.1E-08, BFDP = 0.09; Table 1). However, PanCanQTL did not show any cis-eQTLs, trans-eQTLs nor survival eQTLs for rs78754389 and there was no evidence of association of ARAP2 expression levels with distant metastasis-free survival within ER- breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy based on KMPlotter data (Additional file 2: Supplementary Figure S12). The second genome-wide significant variant was rs117685664, located on chromosome 8 (HR [95% CI] 0.26 [0.16,0.42], P = 4.6E-08, per T allele). This association was not genome-wide significant after accounting for the age at diagnosis and additional tumor characteristics (Table 1), and the corresponding BFDPs from unadjusted and adjusted analysis were 1.00 and 0.99, respectively, indicating a false positive finding. We also observed one additional noteworthy but not genome-wide significant association in the 5-year breast cancer-specific survival analyses in the subgroup of patients who received Tamoxifen with variant rs72775397, situated in the 3' untranslated region of MCTP1 (HR [95% CI] 1.36 [1.21,1.53], P = 1.8E-07, BFDP = 0.11, per C allele). The association was attenuated after adjustment for additional prognostic factors (HR [95% CI] 1.11 [1.04,1.20], P = 3.8E-03, BFDP = 1.00). We did not identify any genome-wide significant or noteworthy association in any of the remaining seven subgroups investigated (Figs. 1 and 2). In addition, none of the above reported associations have a BFDP < 0.15 when considering 10-6 as prior probability of true association (Additional file 3: Supplementary Tables S8). Moreover, none of the subgroup-specific genome-wide significant associations detected by previous studies using a smaller version (both in terms of number of cases and of length of follow-up) of the iCOGS and/or OncoArray BCAC datasets were replicated at P < 0.001 (Additional file 3: Supplementary Table S12).
34407845	DISCUSS	Discussion We investigated the association of over 10 million common germline genetic variants with breast cancer-specific survival within 15 patient subgroups based on prognostic factors representative of tumor biology or related to the type of systemic treatment. Our hypothesis was that focusing on more homogeneous subgroups of breast cancer patients might reveal otherwise undetected associations. Besides type of systemic treatment, the definition of the subgroups was based on current clinically used biological characteristics for tumor subtyping and treatment decisions: patient's age, tumor histological grade, ER, PR, and HER2 status (; Supplementary table S2). We did not have gene expression or copy number aberration data available to classify tumors on the basis of specific biological processes; however, relevant survival differences have been reported among the four subtypes based on ER, PR, and HER2 status. A concern about performing GWAS on several subgroups of patients is the increased proportion of false discoveries, also known as type I errors. For this reason and to overcome additional limitations of the association p values, we made use of the BFDP approach and only considered as robust candidates those associations with BFDP < 0.15 at a prior probability of 10-4. We found evidence of four loci potentially associated with breast cancer survival: one in the subgroup of patients diagnosed with a grade 3 tumor, one in the subgroup of patients with an ER+ tumor and treated with endocrine therapy, and two in the subgroup of patients with an ER- tumor and treated with chemotherapy. The most significant variant identified in the subgroup of grade 3 tumors, rs5934618, is situated in intron 1 of TBL1X, a gene which encodes the Transducin (beta)-like 1X-linked protein. Both TBL1X and the closely related gene TBLR1 have been implicated in the activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, which has been reported to be overactivated in the progression and proliferation of several tumors, including breast tumors, where it has been linked with reduced overall survival. Rs5934618 and the other four correlated variants identified in our genome-wide analysis overlap with chromatin features H3K4me3 and H3K27ac in normal breast; these histone marks are generally characteristics of gene promoters and/or enhancers and might indicate that one or more of these variants act through modulating expression of TBL1X. There was no direct evidence that any of these variants are expression single-nucleotide polymorphisms (eSNPs) for TBL1X, but this might reflect the tissues examined or that the variants only regulate the gene in a specific context. The remaining three variants potentially associated with breast cancer survival were as follows: rs4679741, identified in the subgroup of patients diagnosed with an ER+ tumor and treated with endocrine therapy; rs1106333 and rs78754389, identified in the subgroup of patients diagnosed with an ER- tumor and treated with chemotherapy. For variant rs4679741, it is unclear which the potential target genes might be, while there was no evidence linking the other two variants to the expression of the closest genes in breast cancer nor evidence of association between those genes and survival within the specific subgroups of breast cancer patients. Nevertheless, there are several mechanisms through which the four identified variants could affect survival. For example, they could act through regulation of an unannotated long noncoding RNA or microRNA. Further functional studies including epigenetic mechanisms are needed in order to gain more insights about the detected associations and to ascertain the potential underlying biological mechanisms. We did not find strong evidence of germline variants associated with breast cancer-specific survival in any of the other subgroups of patients investigated. In addition, we did not replicate any of the subgroup-specific associations identified by previous studies. One of these associations, with variant rs4458204, was previously detected in the subgroup of patients with an ER- tumor who received chemotherapy. The estimated HR (95% CI) was 1.81 (1.49-2.19) with association P = 1.9E-09. In our analysis of the same subgroup, we obtained a much lower HR estimate and the association was no longer statistically significant (HR (95% CI) 1.14 (0.99, 1.32), P = 6.0E-02), suggesting that the previous result was a false positive. Even though there is some overlap in terms of patients between the previous study and our current study, the latter is based on a substantially larger number of breast cancer patients and it includes more complete follow-up data. A major strength of our study is the sample size, which was the largest to date and provided reasonable power to detect associations with breast cancer-specific survival within specific subgroups of patients. On the other hand, our study is subject to several limitations that are intrinsic to large consortium studies: these include variation in study design, time periods of diagnosis, and duration of follow-up, all of which can contribute to within subgroup heterogeneity. Some broad treatment-related subgroups, namely ER+ treated with any endocrine therapy and ER- treated with any chemotherapy, may include different treatments due to the wide period of diagnosis included in our study. On the other hand, the majority of patients were diagnosed between 2000 and 2009 (69.9% and 64.5% for ER+ treated with any endocrine therapy and ER- treated with any chemotherapy, respectively). If any impact on the results, the variation in treatment over time might have hampered the detection of associations between variants and survival in these subgroups. Several studies did not report the cause of death for all patients. Out of 14,606 deaths observed within the first 15 years after diagnosis, 7531 (51.6%) were due to breast cancer. Of the remaining 7075 deaths, 4905 (33.6%) were due to causes other than breast cancer, and for 2170 deaths (14.8%) it was unknown whether they were due to breast cancer or to other causes. This will have led to a loss of power, given that most of the deaths of unknown cause are likely to have been due to breast cancer. A related weakness of the study is its dependence on accuracy of cause of death certification and on coding practices of underlying cause of death in different countries. However, despite potential inaccuracies in cause of death, we considered it more valid to focus on deaths reported as due to breast cancer than by considering all deaths together, which would include those due to other causes. An additional limitation of the study is that in most subgroups we had very limited power to detect highly significant associations, particularly for small to moderate effect sizes (HRs 1.05-1.30), even for variants of relatively high minor allele frequency (MAF = 0.20). Therefore, we may have missed variants with low to moderate associations with survival.
34407845	CONCL	Conclusions In conclusion, we found evidence of four loci associated with breast cancer-specific survival within specific patient subgroups. The variants identified appear to be independent of known additional prognostic factors, as shown in the results of the adjusted analyses based on imputed clinic-pathological variables, and could, after proper validation, improve prognostic estimates and potentially help in better stratifying patients in treatment subgroups. However, the power for many subgroups is limited due to the low number of events. Even so, given the lack of evidence of strong associations in many of the patient subgroups investigated, and the fact that previously reported variants were not confirmed, our results suggest that the impact of common germline genetic variant on breast cancer-specific survival might be limited.

22383897	TITLE	Genome-Wide Association Study in East Asians Identifies Novel Susceptibility Loci for Breast Cancer
22383897	ABSTRACT	Genetic factors play an important role in the etiology of both sporadic and familial breast cancer. We aimed to discover novel genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer. We conducted a four-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 19,091 cases and 20,606 controls of East-Asian descent including Chinese, Korean, and Japanese women. After analyzing 690,947 SNPs in 2,918 cases and 2,324 controls, we evaluated 5,365 SNPs for replication in 3,972 cases and 3,852 controls. Ninety-four SNPs were further evaluated in 5,203 cases and 5,138 controls, and finally the top 22 SNPs were investigated in up to 17,423 additional subjects (7,489 cases and 9,934 controls). SNP rs9485372, near the TGF-beta activated kinase (TAB2) gene in chromosome 6q25.1, showed a consistent association with breast cancer risk across all four stages, with a P-value of 3.8x10-12 in the combined analysis of all samples. Adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 0.89 (0.85-0.94) and 0.80 (0.75-0.86) for the A/G and A/A genotypes, respectively, compared with the genotype G/G. SNP rs9383951 (P = 1.9x10-6 from the combined analysis of all samples), located in intron 5 of the ESR1 gene, and SNP rs7107217 (P = 4.6x10-7), located at 11q24.3, also showed a consistent association in each of the four stages. This study provides strong evidence for a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus represented by rs9485372, near the TAB2 gene (6q25.1), and identifies two possible susceptibility loci located in the ESR1 gene and 11q24.3, respectively. Author Summary Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies among women worldwide. Genetic factors play an important role in the etiology of breast cancer. To identify common genetic susceptibility alleles for breast cancer, we performed a four-stage genome-wide association study in 19,091 cases and 20,606 controls among East-Asian women. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs9485372, near the TGF-beta activated kinase 1 (TAB2) gene at chromosome 6q25.1, was associated with breast cancer risk (P = 3.8x10-12). SNPs rs9383951, located in intron 5 of the estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) gene, and rs7107217, located at 11q24.3, were also consistently associated with breast cancer risk in all four stages with a combined P of 1.9x10-6 and 4.6x10-7, respectively. This study provides strong evidence for a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus represented by rs9485372, near the TAB2 gene (6q25.1), and identifies two possible susceptibility loci located in the ESR1 gene and 11q24.3, respectively.
22383897	INTRO	Introduction Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies diagnosed among women worldwide, including those living in East Asian countries. Genetic factors play an important role in the etiology of both sporadic and familial breast cancer. In the past two decades, more than 1,000 reports have been published addressing the association between variants in candidate genes and breast cancer risk. However, only a few genetic risk factors have been confirmed for this common malignancy. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified approximately 20 common genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer. However, these newly-identified genetic factors, along with known high-penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes explain less than 30% of the heritability for this cancer. Furthermore, most GWAS were conducted among women of European ancestry, and many of the variants discovered in European-ancestry populations showed only a weak or no association with breast cancer in other ethnic groups. For example, only 8 of 12 breast cancer risk SNPs identified in women of European ancestry were directly replicated in Chinese population. Therefore, GWAS conducted in non-European women are needed to fully uncover the genetic basis for breast cancer susceptibility. Herein, we report results from a large GWAS of breast cancer conducted in East Asian women.
22383897	RESULTS	Results A total of 19,091 female breast cancer cases and 20,606 female controls:including 23,891 Chinese, 11,907 Korean and 3,809 Japanese women:were included in the present study (Table 1). In Stage I, we analyzed 690,947 SNPs in 2,918 breast cancer cases and 2,324 community controls recruited from studies conducted in Shanghai, China (Figure 1, Text S1). Top 5,365 SNPs were investigated in Stage IIa including 1,613 Chinese cases and 1,800 Chinese controls recruited from studies conducted in Shanghai, China. Of the SNPs evaluated, 68 SNPs showed an association with breast cancer risk at P<=0.05 with the same direction as observed in Stage I. We performed a meta-analysis for the remaining 4,913 SNPs with data available from both Stage IIa and Stage IIb (2,359 Korean cases and 2,052 Korean controls). Twenty-six SNPs showed an association with breast cancer risk with Pmeta<=0.05 and the association was consistent among Stages I, IIa and IIb. These SNPs, along with the 68 SNPs mentioned above, were selected for Stage III replication in 4,712 cases and 4,496 controls. Finally, based on the results of the first three stages, 22 top SNPs were selected for Stage IV evaluation in 7,489 cases and 9,934 controls. SNP rs9485372 showed a statistically significant association with breast cancer risk in each of the four stages (Table 2). The OR (95% CI) per A allele was 0.88 (0.81-0.95), 0.86 (0.81-0.92), 0.94 (0.88-1.00) and 0.90 (0.85-0.94), respectively, for stages I to IV. The association with this SNP was remarkably consistent across all but one small study (Figure 2A). Pooled analysis of samples from all studies produced OR (95% CI) of 0.90 (0.87-0.92) and P-value of 3.8x10-12, which is substantially lower than the conventional genome-wide significance level of 5x10-8 based on conservative Bonferroni adjustment of multiple comparisons at alpha = 0.05, providing strong evidence for an association of this SNP with breast cancer risk. Two other SNPs, rs9383951 and rs7107217, were also consistently replicated in each of the three replication sets. The C allele of rs9383951 was associated with decreased risk with OR (95% CI) of 0.82 (0.73-0.93), 0.90 (0.81-1.00), 0.91 (0.82-1.00), and 0.88 (0.81-0.96), respectively, for stages I to IV (Table 2). The P-value reached 1.9x10-6 in the pooled analysis of samples from all four stages. For SNP rs7107217, the ORs (95% CI) per C allele were 1.13 (1.04-1.23), 1.11 (1.04-1.18), 1.07 (1.00-1.14) and 1.05 (1.01-1.10), respectively, for stages I to IV, respectively (Table 2). Analyses with all subjects combined showed OR (95% CI) of 1.08 (1.05-1.11) and P value of 4.6x10-7. Again, the association of breast cancer risk with these two SNPs was very consistent across the vast majority of participating studies (Figure 2B and 2C). Stratified analyses showed that the associations with these three SNPs were consistent in all three East Asian populations, although the association for SNPs rs9485372 and rs7107217 was not significant for Japanese subjects, probably due to a small sample size (Table 3). Associations of these three SNPs with breast cancer risk were similar when stratified by menopausal or estrogen receptor status and none of the heterogeneity tests was statistically significant (Table S1). No significant interaction was observed with other risk factors (Table S1). After adjusted for the top 5 or 10 principal components, the results did not change significantly (Table S2). Both SNPs rs9485372 and rs9383951 are located at chromosome 6q25.1, approximately 2.34 Mb and 350 kb from the SNP rs2046210 that we previously reported for breast cancer risk. None of these three SNPs, however, are in LD (r2<0.1) in any of the three populations (Asian, European and Africans) as determined using data generated in the HapMap or any of the study populations included in the current study (Table S3 and Figure S1). In an analysis including all 30,153 subjects who were genotyped for three SNPs in 6q25.1, all three SNPs remained strongly associated with breast cancer risk after mutual adjustment of the other 2 SNPs with P values of 1.4x10-12, 1.3x10-4, and 6.0x10-39 for SNPs rs9485372, rs9383951 and rs2046210, respectively (Table S4). No significant interaction was observed for these three SNPs (Table S5). We also created a genetic risk score (GRS) to evaluate the combined effect of three SNPs located in 6q25.1 (Table S6). Compared with women carrying 0-1 risk variants, women carrying 6 variants had over two-fold increased risk with an OR (95% CI) of 2.36 (1.89-2.96) and a P value of 1.3x10-47. A total of 376 SNPs were successfully imputed in the LD blocks including rs2046210 and rs9485372 and the whole ESR1 gene with RSQ>=0.3 and minor allele frequency (MAF)>=0.05. Among them, 27 SNPs showed an association with breast cancer risk with P<=0.05 after adjusted for age, rs9485372, rs9383951 and rs2046210 (Table S7). With the exception of rs4591859 and rs7776340 in the locus of rs2046210 and rs7768330 in the locus of rs9383921, all other SNPs are in the same LD block within the ESR1 gene (Figure S2). No additional SNP in the rs9485372 locus showed an association with breast cancer risk at p<0.05 after adjusted for rs9485372, rs2046210, and rs9383921.

22383897	DISCUSS	Discussion In this large GWAS conducted in East-Asian women including 19,091 cases and 20,606 controls, we provided strong evidence for a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus represented by rs9485372 and suggestive evidence for two other loci, represented by SNPs rs9383951 and rs7107217. We previously reported a genetic susceptibility locus at 6q25.1, represented by rs2046210, for breast cancer risk. The newly identified SNPs, rs9485372 and rs9383951, also are located at chromosome 6q25.1. However, these three SNPs are not in LD and are thus representing independent breast cancer susceptibility loci. All of them were associated with breast cancer risk after mutual adjustment of the other two SNPs. SNP rs9485372 is approximately 31 Kb upstream of the TGF-beta activated kinase 1/MAP3K7 binding protein 2 (TAB2) gene (Figure 3). The protein encoded by this gene is an activator of MAP3K7/TAK1, which is required for the IL-1 induced activation of NF-kappaB and MAPK8/JNK. The TGF-beta pathway plays a major role in breast cancer development and progression. The MAP kinases pathway is critical in regulating cell growth and cell death and may contribute to the development of cancer. Furthermore, the TAB2 protein is required for DNA damage-induced TAK1 activation, suggesting that TAB2 may play a role in DNA damage repair. Other genes in the region identified in the study included SUMO4, LATS1, PPIL4, and UST. However, given the proximity of the TAB2 gene with rs9485372 and the important role of this gene in breast carcinogenesis, it is possible that the association between rs9485372 and breast cancer risk may be mediated through the TAB2 gene. It is also possible that the association may be mediated through regulating the ESR1 gene, located approximately 2.5 Mb from rs9485372. This possibility was highlighted by a recent study showing that several open reading frames in the 6q25.1 regions co-expressed with ESR1 . Further research is warranted to clarify the mechanism of the association identified in the study. SNP rs9383951 is located in intron 5 of the ESR1 gene, an important gene that has been documented to play a key role in breast cancer development and progression. Previous candidate gene studies have extensively evaluated two SNPs, rs2234693 (Pvull) and rs9340799 (XbaI), in the ESR1 gene in relation to breast cancer risk; the results, however, have been inconsistent. Neither rs2234693 nor rs9340799 are in LD (r2<0.01) with the SNPs discovered in the present study. To follow-up the lead from our previous study reporting a susceptibility locus at 6q25.1 for breast cancer, two recent studies conducted among women of European descent identified rs3757318 and rs9397435 in relation to breast cancer risk. These two SNPs are in strong LD (r2>0.6 in Asians) with the SNP (rs2046210) we previously reported at 6q25.1 in East Asians but not in other populations. Again, these two SNPs are not in LD (r2<0.01 in Asian, European and African populations) with rs9383951 and rs9485372 identified in this study. Although the association with rs9383951 did not reach the conventional genome-wide significance, the fact that this SNP is located in the ESR1 gene strongly suggests a true association of this SNP with breast cancer risk. SNP rs7107217 also showed a consistent association in all four stages, although the pooled P-value did not reach the conventional genome-wide significance level. This SNP is located at 11q24.3, 152 Kb downstream of the BARX2 gene and 212 Kb upstream of the TMEM45B gene (Figure S3). BARX2 is a homeobox gene for which the mouse ortholog has been shown to influence cellular processes that control cell adhesion and cytoskeleton remodeling. It has been shown, BARX2 and estrogen receptor-alpha (ESR1) coordinately regulate the production of alternatively spliced ESR1 isoforms and control breast cancer cell growth and invasion. BARX2 also acts in a tumor suppressor and loss of heterozygosity of this gene, lead to poorer survival in patients with ovarian cancer. It could be ideal to increase the sample size in the discovery stage and simplify the replication stages of the study. However, like many other consortium projects, financial constraints and some logistical issues prevented us for achieving the maximum statistical power. Nevertheless, with approximately 40,000 cases and controls, our study represents the largest breast cancer genetic association study in East Asian women. This consortium will continue to provide valuable resources to identify additional novel susceptibility loci for breast cancer. In summary, in this large GWAS conducted in East Asia women, we provided convincing evidence for an association with a novel independent susceptibility locus located at 6q25.1, near the TAB2 gene. Our study also suggests that genetic variants in the ESR1 gene and chromosome 11q24.3 may be related to breast cancer risk. Given that multiple independent breast cancer susceptibility loci have identified in our studies and studies conducted by others in 6q25.1 that harbors the ESR1 gene, it is possible that 6q25.1 may represent an important region for breast cancer susceptibility.
22383897	METHODS	Methods Study populations Included in this consortium project were 19,091 cases and 20,606 controls from 14 studies (Table 1). Detailed descriptions of these participating studies and demographic characteristics of study participants are provided in Text S1. Briefly, the consortium included 23,981 Chinese women, 11,907 Korean women, 3,809 Japanese women. The Chinese women were from 8 studies: Shanghai [n = 13,642, Shanghai Breast Cancer Study, Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study (SBCSS), Shanghai Endometrial Cancer Study (SECS), Shanghai Women Health Study (SWHS)], , Nanjing (n = 3,623), Tianjin (n = 2,882), Taiwan (n = 2,131), and Guangzhou (n = 1,703). The Korean women were from four studies [Seoul Breast Cancer Study (SeBCS) (n = 6,292), Korea NCC (n = 1,009), KoGES (n = 3,209), and KOHBRA (n = 1,397) ]. The Japanese women were from three studies conducted in Hawaii and Los Angeles [n = 1,719; Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC) ], Nagoya (n = 1,288), and Nagano (n = 802) (Table 1). Approval was granted from relevant institutional review boards in all study sites; all included subjects gave informed consent. Genotyping methods The Genotyping protocol for Stage I has been described previously. Briefly, the initial 300 subjects were genotyped using the Affymetrix GeneChip Mapping 500K Array Set. The remaining 4,985 subjects were genotyped using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0. We included one negative control and at least three positive quality control (QC) samples from the Coriell Cell Repositories (http://ccr.coriell.org/) in each of the 96-well plates for Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0 genotyping. A total of 273 positive QC samples were successfully genotyped, and the average concordance rate was 99.9% with a median value of 100%. The sex of all study samples was confirmed to be female. Genetically identical, unexpected duplicated samples were excluded, as were close relatives with a pair-wise proportion of identify-by-descent (IBD) estimate greater than 0.25. All samples with a call rate<95% were excluded. The SNPs were excluded if: (i) MAF<1%, (ii) call rate<95%, or (iii) genotyping concordance rate<95% in quality control samples. The final dataset included 2,918 cases and 2,324 controls for 690,947 markers. There are 21,223 SNPs that were on Affymetrix 500K Array Set but not on the Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0. These SNPs were excluded. SNPs on the Affymetrix 6.0 array but not on the Affymetrix 500k array were treated as missing data for those samples genotyped on using the Affymetrix 500k array. Similar results were obtained after excluding women genotyped by Affymetrix 500K Array Set from the analyses. Genotyping for Stage IIa was completed using the Illumina iSelect platform. To compare the consistency between the Affymetrix and Illumina iSelect platforms, we also included 43 samples from Stage I that were genotyped by Affymetrix SNP 6.0. Similar to the QC procedures used in Stage I, the following criteria were used to exclude samples: (i) call rate<95%; or (ii) unexpected duplicated samples based on IBD estimate. SNPs were excluded if: (i) call rate<95%, or (ii) genotyping concordance rate<95% in quality control samples when compared with Affymetrix 6.0 data. After QC, the mean concordance rate was 99.85% between Illumina iSelect and Affymetrix 6.0 genotyping. Data for the SNPs analyzed in Stage IIb were extracted from the Korean GWAS genotyped using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 chip. A total of 30 QC samples were successfully genotyped, and the concordance rate was 99.83%. The sex of all samples was confirmed to be female. The SNPs were excluded if: (1) genotype call rate<95%, (2) MAF<1% in either the cases or controls, (3) deviation from HWE at P-value<10-6, and (4) poor cluster plot in either the cases or controls. Genotyping for Stage III and all samples from Koreans in Stage IV was completed using the iPLEX Sequenom MassArray platform in the Vanderbilt Molecular Epidemiology Laboratory. Included in each 96-well plate as QC samples were one negative control (water), two blinded duplicates, and two samples from the HapMap project. To compare the consistency between the Affymetrix and Sequenom platforms, we also genotyped 45 samples included in Stage I. The mean concordance rate was 99.67% for the blind duplicates, 98.88% for HapMap samples, and 99.52% between Sequenom and Affymetrix 6.0 genotyping. Data quality from the Hong Kong study was low and thus data from the study were excluded for the current analysis. Genotyping for two Chinese studies (Nanjing and Guangzhou) in Stage IV was completed using the iPLEX Sequenom MassArray platform at the Fudan University, Shanghai, China. Blind duplicate QC samples were included and the mean concordance rate was 98.70%. Genotyping for the Tianjin study in Stage IV was performed using TaqMan assays. Genotyping assay protocols were developed and validated at the Vanderbilt Molecular Epidemiology Laboratory, and TaqMan genotyping assay reagents were provided to investigators of the Tianjin study (Tianjin Cancer Institute and Hospital). For the MEC study, data for the three SNPs presented in this study were extracted from the GWA scan data generated using Illumina 660W. For SNPs not included on the chip, imputed data using HapMap as reference were extracted. Genotype frequencies for SNP rs9485372 deviated from HWE in controls (P = 0.004), therefore, this SNP was excluded in data analyses. Not all SNPs for Stage IV were genotyped in all studies included in Stage IV due to genotyping failure or the use of different genotyping platforms (Table S8). SNP selection for replication SNP selection for Stage II replication: Promising SNPs were selected for replication in Stage II based on the following criteria: 1) minor allele frequency (MAF)>=5%; 2) P<0.02 in Stage I; 3) Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test P>1.0x10-6 in controls; 4) not in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r2<0.5) with any of the previously confirmed breast cancer genetic risk variants or SNPs evaluated in our previous studies; and 5) high genotyping quality as indicated by very clear genotyping clusters checked manually. When multiple SNPs are in LD with r2>=0.5, one SNP with the lowest P-value was selected. In total, 6,303 SNPs were selected for replication. A total of 5,906 SNPs (93.7%) were successfully designed by Illumina and included in the iSelect array. After stringent QC procedures, data from 5,365 SNPs were considered high quality for association analyses in Stage IIa, which include 1,613 breast cancer patients and 1,800 controls recruited from Shanghai studies. SNP selection for Stage III replication: Among the 5,365 SNPs successfully genotyped in Stage IIa, 68 SNPs were selected for Stage III replication in an independent set of 5,203 cases and 5,138 controls recruited from Shanghai and several other East Asian populations (Table 1 and Text S1). The selection criteria are: 1) an association with breast cancer risk in Stage IIa with P<=0.05; 2) the direction of the association consistent in both stages; and 3) P<=0.001 in the merged data of Stage I and IIa. During the course of Stage III genotyping, genome-wide association scan data from 2,359 cases and 2,052 controls were obtained from the Seoul Breast Cancer GWAS (Stage IIb). Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of Stage IIa and IIb data. Of the 5,297 SNPs which were not selected initially for Stage III replication based on Stage IIa data alone, data were available for 4,913 SNPs in Stage IIb. Meta-analyses of these 4,913 SNPs from Stage IIa and IIb yielded 26 additional SNPs that showed an association at P<=0.05 and in the same direction among stages I, IIa, and IIb. These 26 SNPs were then added to the list of SNPs to be genotyped in Stage III. SNP selection for Stage IV replication: Based on the results of the first three stages, 22 top SNPs were selected for Stage IV evaluation and genotyped in up to 17,423 additional subjects (7,489 cases and 9,934 controls) (Table 1 and Text S1). Statistical analyses Case-control differences in selected demographic characteristics and major risk factors were evaluated using t-tests (for continuous variables) and Chi-square tests (for categorical variables). Associations between SNPs and breast cancer risk were assessed using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) derived from logistic regression models. ORs were estimated for heterozygote and homozygote for the variant allele compared with homozygotes for the common allele. ORs were also estimated for the variant allele based on a log-additive model and adjusted for age, and study site, when appropriate. Stratified analyses by ethnicity, menopausal status, and estrogen receptor (ER) status were carried out. PLINK version 1.06 was used to analyze genome-wide data obtained in Stage I and the replication data in Stage IIa. Results from Stage IIb were also obtained from PLINK version 1.06. Meta-analyses of Stage IIa and Stage IIb were performed using a weighted z-statistics method, where weights were proportional to the square root of the number of individuals in each sample and standardized such that the weights added up to one. The z-statistic summarizes the magnitude and direction of the effect relative to the reference allele. An overall z-statistic and p value were then calculated from the weighted average of the individual statistics. Calculations were implemented in the METAL package (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/Metal). Individual data were obtained from each study for Stage IV SNPs for a pooled analysis, which were conducted using SAS, version 9.2, with the use of two-tailed tests. We first investigated the population structure by estimating inflation factor lambda using all 690,947 SNPs SNPs that passed the QC. The inflation factor lambda was estimated to be 1.042, suggesting that any population substructure, if present, should not have any appreciable effect on the results. Among the final 690,947 SNPs obtained in Stage I after QC, we generated a list of 196,471 SNPs with pairwise LD<0.2 by using plink (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/). Then, principal components were estimated based on these 196,471 SNPs using EIGENSTRAT. We then drew a plot for all Stage I and HapMap II subjects based on the first two principal components (Figure 4). All study participants in Stage I were clustered very closely with HapMap Asians. The first 5 or 10 principal components were adjusted in the logistic regression analyses for evaluating associations of SNPs and breast cancer risk. To evaluate the combined effect of SNPs located in chromosome 6q25.1 on breast cancer risk, we created a genetic risk score (GRS) by summing the number (0-2) of risk alleles that each woman carried for each of the three SNPs, including rs9383951, rs9485372, rs2046210. The GRS was constructed among those who had complete data for all three SNPs. We also did imputation using MACH (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MACH/index.html) with HapMap II Asian data as reference. LD structure was estimated from the flanking 100 kb of these three SNPs and the ESR1 gene using data from HapMap II Asians (Figure S1). All SNPs in the LD blocks including rs9485372, rs2046210 and rs9383951 and SNPs inside the ESR1 gene were analyzed in relation to breast cancer risk with age, rs9485372, rs9383951 and rs2046210 adjusted.

29698419	TITLE	Genetic susceptibility markers for a breast-colorectal cancer phenotype: Exploratory results from genome-wide association studies
29698419	ABSTRACT	Background Clustering of breast and colorectal cancer has been observed within some families and cannot be explained by chance or known high-risk mutations in major susceptibility genes. Potential shared genetic susceptibility between breast and colorectal cancer, not explained by high-penetrance genes, has been postulated. We hypothesized that yet undiscovered genetic variants predispose to a breast-colorectal cancer phenotype. Methods To identify variants associated with a breast-colorectal cancer phenotype, we analyzed genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from cases and controls that met the following criteria: cases (n = 985) were women with breast cancer who had one or more first- or second-degree relatives with colorectal cancer, men/women with colorectal cancer who had one or more first- or second-degree relatives with breast cancer, and women diagnosed with both breast and colorectal cancer. Controls (n = 1769), were unrelated, breast and colorectal cancer-free, and age- and sex- frequency-matched to cases. After imputation, 6,220,060 variants were analyzed using the discovery set and variants associated with the breast-colorectal cancer phenotype at P<5.0E-04 (n = 549, at 60 loci) were analyzed for replication (n = 293 cases and 2,103 controls). Results Multiple correlated SNPs in intron 1 of the ROBO1 gene were suggestively associated with the breast-colorectal cancer phenotype in the discovery and replication data (most significant; rs7430339, Pdiscovery = 1.2E-04; rs7429100, Preplication = 2.8E-03). In meta-analysis of the discovery and replication data, the most significant association remained at rs7429100 (P = 1.84E-06). Conclusion The results of this exploratory analysis did not find clear evidence for a susceptibility locus with a pleiotropic effect on hereditary breast and colorectal cancer risk, although the suggestive association of genetic variation in the region of ROBO1, a potential tumor suppressor gene, merits further investigation.
29698419	INTRO	"Introduction Population-based studies have revealed a strong clustering of breast and colorectal cancer within some families. This clustering has given rise to speculation that there are ""breast-colon"" cancer susceptibility genes for which there are variants that predispose to co-occurrence of breast and colorectal cancer. While co-occurrence of these two common cancers in some families could be due to chance, there is evidence that members of families with segregating germline mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2 and CHEK2 genes (which are associated with breast cancer) are also at moderately increased risk of colorectal cancer. Similarly, families with germline mutations in the MLH1 or MSH2 genes responsible for Lynch syndrome, or with mutations in the LKB1/STK11 gene responsible for Peutz-Jeghers syndrome are known to cosegregate the two cancers. However, these relatively rare syndromes cannot explain all the observed familial clustering of breast and colorectal cancer. Daley et al., using a sib-pair analysis of a genome-wide linkage scan of 33 families with a breast-colorectal cancer phenotype, detected multiple linkage peaks, one of them in the region of BRCA2. They also detected other novel linked regions, including D17S1308 on chromosome 17p, in close proximity to the candidate gene hypermethylated in cancer 1 gene, HIC1. Two recent population based studies have also found suggestive evidence for a positive genetic correlation between colorectal and breast cancer. Lindstrom and colleagues quantified genetic correlation between different cancer types and found shared heritability of 0.22 for breast and colorectal cancer (P = 0.01). Similarly, Yu and colleagues used the vast Swedish Family-Cancer Database, to identify a modestly increased risk of breast cancer among families of probands affected with colorectal cancer, after excluding cases with a known hereditary predisposition. Further evidence to support the hypothesis that there are additional susceptibility genes is the observation that many families/persons fit our definition of a breast-colorectal cancer phenotype (clustering of breast and colorectal cancer in at least two first- or second-degree relatives in a family, or persons affected with synchronous or metachronous breast and colorectal cancers), but do not have mutations in the known breast or colorectal cancer genes. These families/persons, however, often exhibit features of an inherited predisposition, such as cancer diagnosis at a young age, a Mendelian inheritance pattern, and presence of multiple cancers such as both breast and colorectal cancers in the same person. Such families/persons are suggestive of yet undiscovered susceptibility genes for breast and colorectal cancers and continue to be a challenge for clinical geneticists and their patients because of the difficulty in estimating cancer risk for relatives and defining strategies for future surveillance. The identification of genetic markers associated with the risk of a breast-colorectal cancer phenotype has clinical implications for prevention and screening/surveillance guidelines. Further, it could aid in identifying families/persons who are at high-risk of an inherited predisposition for breast and colorectal cancer, but do not have any of the known high-penetrance mutations. Therefore the aim of this study was to identify novel susceptibility markers for this understudied phenotype using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that included discovery and replication phases. We hypothesized that this phenotype is clinically distinct from known hereditary breast and colorectal cancer predisposition syndromes and that unique susceptibility genes influence genetic predisposition to a breast-colorectal cancer phenotype, putting some families and persons at increased risk of both breast and colorectal cancer."
29698419	METHODS	Materials and methods Discovery Phase Data sources The primary sources were the Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR) and the Breast Cancer Family Registry (BCFR) both established to support studies on the etiology, prevention, and clinical management of colorectal and breast cancer, respectively. The CCFR is an international consortium of six sites in North America and Australia for which recruitment of colorectal cancer case families and controls occurred between 1998 and 2012. The BCFR is a collaboration of six sites in North America and Australia for which recruitment commenced in 1996. Both CFRs used standardized protocols to collect blood and tissue samples, and questionnaires to collect information about family history, personal and environmental risk factors. By design, both registries are enriched for families with multiple cancer-affected family members. GWAS data Three separate GWASs were undertaken by the CCFR and BCFR from which data for our study were sourced. All subjects were non-Hispanic white. For the CCFR GWASs, 1189 population-based colorectal cancer cases and 986 unrelated population-based controls were genotyped in Phase 1 in 2009, and 825 cases and 825 same-generation family controls were genotyped in Phase 2 in 2010. The CCFR Phase 1 samples were genotyped on an Illumina Human1M v1 and/or Illumina Human 1M-Duo v3.0 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, and the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad v1.0 array for Phase 2 (~50% overlap with the 1M array used in Phase 1). The BCFR GWAS consisted of population-based case women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer before age 51 years, and women controls between the ages of 20 and 51 years with no history of breast cancer. Genotyping was performed using Illumina 610 Quad and Illumina Cyto12 SNP BeadChip arrays. All GWAS studies excluded cases with a known or likely hereditary predisposition syndrome. The CCFR GWASs excluded colorectal cancer cases with familial adenomatous polyposis; with microsatellite unstable tumors; with tumors for which immunohistochemistry revealed loss of DNA mismatch repair protein; with an MYH mutation; or with a known deleterious mismatch repair gene mutation. The BCFR GWAS excluded breast cancer cases with known BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations. The data were accessed by submitting a proposal and obtaining approval from the CCFR/BCFR Data Access Committees (CCFR: http://www.coloncfr.org/collaboration; BCFR: http://www.bcfamilyregistry.org/for-researchers/initiate-collaborations). The CFR data can be similarly accessed by researchers with appropriate approvals. Participating studies All cases and controls for the Discovery Phase were selected from the CCFR or BCFR GWASs and included data from five CCFR and three BCFR sites (Table 1). Cases were defined as: 1) women diagnosed with breast cancer who had one or more first- or second-degree relatives with colorectal cancer; or 2) persons diagnosed with colorectal cancer who had one or more first- or second-degree relatives with breast cancer; or 3) persons diagnosed with both breast and colorectal cancer, irrespective of which cancer was diagnosed first and the time between the two cancer diagnoses. The BCFR GWAS included only women younger than 51 years. Controls were sex- and age-matched (within 5 years) to the cases, unrelated to cases, and not known to have a personal or family history of breast or colorectal cancer. Based on these criteria 1,078 cases and 2,001 controls were used in the Discovery Phase. The study was approved by the MD Anderson Institutional Review Board (IRB) and by the respective IRBs of the data providing CFR sites where written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to collecting the data. Quality control Standard quality control (QC) measures were implemented on the CCFR and BCFR GWAS datasets. For our study the CCFR dataset consisted of 1,528,306 SNPs (612 cases and 999 controls), and the BCFR dataset consisted of 1,265,521 SNPs (391 cases, 788 controls). For each independent dataset, we applied filters to exclude SNPs with >0.05 missing genotype, minor allele frequency <0.01 and deviation from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (P<1.0E-05) using PLINK v1.07. For the BCFR data, 1,214,531 SNPs were retained after the initial QC (1790 SNPs failed the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium test, and 49,200 SNPs failed the minor allele frequency filter). For the CCFR data, 465,717 common SNPs from two SNP array platforms were retained after the initial QC (998,821 SNPs failed the missing genotype filter, and 579,054 SNPs failed the minor allele frequency filter). The number of CCFR SNPs decreased substantially after removing the SNPs with >0.05 missing genotypes because the CCFR samples were genotyped on two different SNP platforms with ~50% overlap between the platforms. After filtering, 465,717 CCFR SNPs and 1,214,531 BCFR SNPs remained for a sample of 1,003 cases and 1,787 controls. The datasets from both CFRs were merged and the combined BCFR and CCFR data had 433,277 common SNPs. Additional QC filters were applied for relatedness (a first- or second-degree relative inferred by pairwise allele sharing estimates of identity by descent), mismatch between called and phenotypic sex. There were no sex-discrepant individuals but two cases and four controls were removed due to relatedness (PI HAT > 0.15 after the PLINK IBS test). For this filtered dataset, principal components analysis was performed to remove population outliers using PLINK v1.07 (detailed documentation of the PLINK commands can be found at http://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/strat.shtml#cluster); 16 cases and 12 controls were removed because they were 4 or more standard deviations from the centroid ( Z  > 4), and 2 additional controls were removed as outliers after running the smartpca script in Eigenstrat. Finally we had 985 cases and 1787 controls. After removal of the outliers, the PC eigenvectors were recalculated, and the first 6 principal components were included in the association analyses. SNP imputation The imputation of un-typed SNPs was performed on the merged dataset from 1000 Genomes CEPH data reference panels (Phase 1 Version 3, NCBI build 37 [hg19]) using MaCH 1.0.16 and MiniMac (2012-05-29 release) from 1000 genomes Phase I V3 20101123 release EUR reference panel of 1092 samples. SNPs with quality scores of <0.8 were removed. After imputation, filtering on minor allele frequency>0.01, and imputation quality r2>0.8, there were 6,220,060 total imputed SNPs. Discovery analysis Genome-wide association analyses to identify genetic loci associated with a breast-colorectal cancer phenotype were computed by logistic regression, in an additive genetic model (per allele additive trend test), adjusting for study (CCFR or BCFR), age, sex and six PCs. The analyses for the imputed data were performed using ProbABEL (version 0.4.1; release data August 29, 2013). We generated quantile-quantile plots and calculated genomic inflation factors to estimate the inflation in test statistics arising from any systematic causes of bias. Replication Phase The top 549 SNPs associated with the breast-colorectal cancer phenotype at P<5.0E-04 across 18 chromosomes in the Discovery Phase were selected for replication using the colorectal cancer GWAS studies that are part of the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO). Details regarding studies participating in GECCO, GWAS genotyping, imputation, and QC have been described elsewhere. Using the same case and control definitions as in the Discovery Phase, 293 cases and 2,103 controls from three GWAS datasets (Women's Health Initiative [WHI] 1, WHI 2, and VITamins And Lifestyle cohort [VITAL]) were eligible for inclusion in the Replication Phase (Table 1). All cases had a diagnosis of colorectal cancer with a family history of breast cancer in a first-or second-degree relative. Moreover, all cases and controls were non-Hispanic white women because both WHI cohorts consisted of women only, and family history of breast cancer for men in the VITAL cohort was not reported. Replication analysis was performed using a marginal logistic regression model for each study, followed by a meta-analysis of the study level results. Age, center and three PCs were included in the model. Meta-analysis of the discovery and replication phases Association P-values of the discovery data (CCFR and BCFR) and replication data (GECCO) were meta-analyzed using the Genome-wide Association Meta-Analysis Software, GWAMA (v. 2.1), which uses an inverse variance method. Overlap with variants detected by breast and colorectal GWASs Published GWAS SNPs associated with breast cancer (n = 99) and with colorectal cancer (n = 39) for Europeans/ non-Hispanic whites were extracted from HaploReg version 3 [accessed on 3/20/18]. We examined results of association analysis for these GWAS SNPs in our Discovery Phase dataset. Overlap with functional elements in the genome Encyclopedia of DNA Elements data were queried to assess overlap with potentially functional genomic characteristics such as DNase I hypersensitivity sites, transcription factor regulatory regions and enhancer elements. Similarly, RegulomeDB and HaploReg version 4 were queried to assess overlap of the SNPs with regulatory genomic regions.

29698419	RESULTS	Results Data for 985 cases and 1769 controls from 5 CCFR sites and 3 BCFR sites were analyzed in the Discovery Phase (Table 1). The CCFR dataset consisted of 589 cases of colorectal cancer with a family history of breast cancer and 13 cases with breast and colorectal cancer (n = 602 cases). Similarly, the BCFR dataset included 378 breast cancer cases with a family history of colorectal cancer and 5 women with breast and colorectal cancer (n = 383 cases). All cases and controls were non-Hispanic whites. Most participants were women (72.9% of cases and 73.2% of controls). The controls were older than the cases in the overall sample (mean ages 51.5 versus 49.4 years) although the BCFR cases and controls were younger than the CCFR cases and controls (Table 1). The genomic inflation factor was lambda = 1.02 (see quantile-quantile plot, S1 Fig). The most significant association signal from the genome-wide association analysis was for rs12548629 on chromosome 8q22.3 (P = 2.5E-07), an intronic SNP in BAALC (Table 2, and S2 Fig). We found no genome-wide significant variants (at P<5.0E-08). Using a lower threshold (P<5.0E-04), we identified 60 suggestive regions/loci across the genome, on multiple chromosomes (chromosomes 1-12 and 16-20). The most significant SNP associations at each locus are listed in Table 2. A majority of the associated variants were in non-coding or intergenic regions. SNPs likely to affect binding or gene expression are indicated by a low score from RegulomeDB. Two potentially functional SNPs, rs11666622 (3'UTR) and rs1468348 (RegulomeDB score 1f) were annotated because they were in linkage disequilibrium (r2>0.9) with the SNP with the smallest P-value in the region. We investigated these loci further using the replication dataset for potential association with a breast-colorectal cancer phenotype. Results of association testing for SNPs with a P<5.0E-04 are provided in S1 Table. Replication of the most significant SNP associations (n = 549 SNPs) in 60 regions on 18 chromosomes was performed using 293 cases and 2,103 controls, from 3 studies in GECCO. All cases and controls were women and the mean ages were 66.4 and 67.7 years, respectively (Table 1). The replication analysis of the 549 SNPs revealed multiple correlated SNPs in the 3p12, 9p13.3, and 18q12.2 regions that were significantly associated at P<0.05 (most significant SNP, rs7429100, P = 2.8E-03) along with three independent SNPs on 5p13.3, 9p22.2 and 20p11.23 (Table 3). The signal on chromosome 8 around the BAALC gene did not replicate (P = 0.54). The meta-analysis of discovery and replication results did not identify a genome-wide significant signal (smallest meta P was for rs7429100 on chromosome 3p12.3, P = 1.84E-06; Table 3). The strongest suggestive association from the combined dataset (on 3p12.3) was for several highly correlated SNPs in the region of the roundabout guidance receptor 1 gene, ROBO1 (P ranging between 1.8-9.6E-06; Table 3). The ROBO1 signal was driven by 53 highly correlated SNPs (r2: 0.78-1.0) in intron 1. Association results for the published GWAS hits for breast and colorectal cancer were nominally significant at P <0.05 for 4/39 colorectal cancer-associated SNPs and 5/99 breast cancer-associated SNPs (S2 Table and S3 Table). The nominally significant SNPs included colorectal cancer GWAS SNPs in SMAD7, C11orf93, SCG5, and ATF1, and breast cancer SNPs related to CDKN2B-AS1, FGFR2, GDI2, CDYL2 (S2 Table and S3 Table). The in silico functional analysis of the ROBO1 SNPs displayed a range of altered binding motifs: rs9878764 had protein binding activity with CEBPB (CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein Beta), but no breast or colorectal tissue specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) were associated with any of the ROBO1 SNPs (S4 Table). However, ROBO1 gene expression is fairly ubiquitous across multiple human tissues (S3 Fig), and ROBO1 is frequently mutated across almost all cancer types (S4 Fig), including breast and colon.
29698419	DISCUSS	Discussion In this study, we analyzed GWAS data from the Colon and Breast Cancer Family Registries in cases enriched for family history of breast and colorectal cancer, and controls, to agnostically identify novel markers of genetic susceptibility for the joint breast-colorectal cancer phenotype. Our cases were diagnosed at a younger age (mean age, 49.4 years), which coupled with their cancer family histories, favors the likelihood of a genetic predisposition. Our main findings include a suggestive association of a cluster of SNPs in ROBO1 with the breast-colorectal cancer phenotype, although none of the SNPs were genome-wide statistically significant. There has been long interest and debate around possible genetic susceptibility to a distinct breast-colorectal cancer phenotype. The clustering of breast and colorectal cancer in families was described as early as in 1972 by Lynch et al. who found that some families where many members had breast cancer also had a high predisposition to colorectal cancer. Subsequently, the idea of a distinct hereditary breast and colorectal cancer phenotype (HBCC) was proposed by Meijers-Heijboer and colleagues, when they found a significant association of the CHEK2 1100delC mutation with HBCC using a subset of familial breast cancer families that did not carry the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. However, a larger study did not confirm the HBCC syndrome as a separate entity linked to the CHEK2 1100delC mutation, suggesting that HBCC could be due to chance or yet undiscovered genes. A similar message was conveyed in a commentary by Lipton and colleagues, who suggested that other than the known clinical syndromes, many breast-colorectal cancer families probably result from chance clustering of two common cancers or through a genetic predisposition to one of the cancers and chance co-occurrence of the other. However, they acknowledged that there are families that present with evidence of genetic disease not accounted for by known genes or chance. They also posited that it may be difficult to identify potential breast-colorectal cancer genes, suggesting a candidate gene analysis approach as the most suited (at the time, in the pre-GWAS era). GWAS data has now allowed us to look beyond candidate genes to use genetic variation across the genome to try to identify breast-colorectal cancer susceptibility loci. In the present study, no genome-wide significant loci were detected in the Discovery Phase but we found some suggestive associations, across multiple chromosomes, the most promising on chromosome 8q22.3, overlying the BAALC gene. However, of the 549 SNPs at 60 loci tested for replication, BAALC SNPs did not replicate but P-values <5.0E-03 were found for several correlated SNPs in the region of chromosome 3p12.3; the ROBO1 gene. Although suggestive, the association signal did not meet the Bonferroni multiple testing threshold, (P<9.1E-05 for testing 549 SNPs, or <8.3E-04 if considering 60 loci) but the cluster of SNPs in intron 1 of the ROBO1 gene also had the smallest P-values from meta-analysis of the discovery and replication datasets (Psmallest = 1.84E-06; rs7429100). ROBO1 merits follow-up as it may have a potential functional role in breast-colorectal carcinogenesis. A transmembrane receptor of the immunoglobulin family, ROBO1interacts with SLIT2 (Slit Guidance Ligand 2) to regulate many biological functions, is differentially expressed in human cancers, and has a possible role as a tumor suppressor gene. Studies have found that low ROBO1 expression is an adverse prognostic factor for breast cancer and might play a role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Evidence in support of ROBO1 as a susceptibility gene for a hereditary breast-colorectal cancer (HBCC) phenotype comes from a study by Villacis and colleagues. The aim of their study was to identify genomic alterations (copy number variations, CNVs) related to cancer predisposition in patients with a suggestive HBCC phenotype who did not carry high risk mutations in the major genes known to be implicated in hereditary breast or colorectal cancer (i.e., patients who met HBCC criteria as defined by Naseem et al.). The authors identified a ROBO1 germline deletion in intron 4, spanning 37.470 kb (chr3:78,990,568-79,028,038 hg18), in three unrelated cases out of 113 HBCC patients. Pathogenicity of the deletion was supported by familial co-segregation with disease, its rarity in public CNV databases, and in silico evidence of the deletion having a functional role due to the presence of several enhancers and a histone marker in the deleted region. Notably, the authors reported that direct sequencing did not reveal any pathogenic point mutations in ROBO1. From our data and analyses, the association signal for ROBO1, comprised a cluster of 53 SNPs in intron 1, spanning 87.866 kb (79,703,548-79,791,414 hg 18) and the SNP closest to the deletion was located 675.51 kb away from the deletion. Furthermore, unlike the rare deletion identified by Villacis and colleagues, these were common SNPs with a minor allele frequency ranging between 0.39-0.46. Of the published GWAS SNPs associated with colorectal cancer risk and breast cancer risk, our analysis of the combined breast-colorectal dataset found that only a few SNPs were nominally significant at P<0.05. The SMAD7 SNP rs4939827, identified as a colorectal cancer risk SNP was the most significantly associated SNP in our breast-colorectal data (P = 1.85E-04) with a consistent direction of association for the risk allele (T). To our knowledge, there is no published evidence of association of this SNP with breast cancer risk, although a role of SMAD7 in the modulation of cancer growth and progression has been suggested for many cancers, including breast cancer. Among the GWAS SNPs known to be associated with breast cancer risk, notable were two FGFR2 SNPs (rs298175 and rs2981582) that were nominally significant in our breast-colorectal data. Genetic alternations in FGFR2 have been found to be associated with cancers other than breast but we have not found any association of FGFR2 SNPs with colorectal cancer in the published literature. Unlike the present study, which used a familial clustering approach used to identify cases, other studies have applied a meta-analysis approach to large GWAS datasets to identify common genetic susceptibility variants across multiple cancers. For example, using colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer genome-wide data for ~13,000 cases unselected for age of disease onset or family history, and ~40,000 controls, Cheng and colleagues identified two novel polymorphisms, rs3184504 in the SH2B3 gene and rs12970291 near the TSHZ1 gene with evidence for a shared colorectal and endometrial cancer predisposition. Another study by Hung and colleagues reported that the same SH2B3 SNP on chr12q24 was associated with lung, colorectal and breast cancer. In our study, however, we did not find an association of rs3184504 or any other variant in the chr12q24 region, with the breast-colorectal cancer phenotype. Furthermore, a recent comprehensive analysis of pleiotropic associations across five cancers using 61,851 cases and 61,850 controls did not find any evidence of pleiotropy across breast and colorectal cancer, which suggests that these two cancers may not have a common genetic susceptibility mechanism. The strengths of the present study include using an agnostic approach to identify genetic susceptibility loci, and its enrichment for genetic susceptibility through the incorporation of early cancer onset (for breast cancer) and family history to define the breast-colorectal cancer phenotype. Furthermore, any breast-colorectal GWAS signal was less likely to be due to syndromic cases since all cases carrying BRCA1 or BRCA2 or known colorectal cancer susceptibility gene mutations were excluded from the GWAS. Despite this, our study could have had limited statistical power to detect alleles with small true effect sizes especially if they are rare. Our study was powered to detect risk alleles with a frequency greater than 10% and a per-allele odds ratio of 1.7. Although this detectable odds ratio is high for a GWAS, we reasoned that because the cases had a family history, the frequency of the risk allele could be higher than it would be for unselected cases. Study power could also have been reduced because data were from different GWAS platforms, however, imputation of genetic variants after merging datasets allowed us to maximize genetic markers for our analyses. Another potential limitation was that the breast cancer cases being younger had less time to be diagnosed with CRC and similarly, the relatives had fewer person-years at risk for CRC, than cases that had incident CRC and were older. Furthermore, although the cases were identified based on family history, the inclusion criteria regarding the number of relatives affected or case subjects' age at cancer onset were not stringent. This is in contrast to the HBCC criteria suggested by Naseem and colleagues, which included age of colorectal or breast cancer onset <50 years as a defining feature for the affected or relative. We used the relaxed criteria to obtain a larger sample size and increase the power to detect an association, as this was an exploratory analysis, however power may be reduced due to smaller effect sizes. Future studies of affected families with stronger clustering of breast and colorectal cancer, might reveal a specific genetic signal. There is also the possibility of recall bias in the capture of family history between cases and controls, however, if the controls had unreported breast or colorectal cancer-affected first- or second-degree relatives, it may lead to type 2 (false-negatives) rather than type 1 error. Finally, the study was limited by the lack of availability of a large dataset for replication. While many thousands of people have been genotyped in the GWASs, these studies provide only limited phenotype data, and most notably, lack data on cancer family history. Lack of replication could also be because the replication data did not closely resemble the discovery data due to the inclusion of only women with a higher mean age in the replication series, in contrast to the discovery data which included both men and women who were relatively younger. This analysis, aimed at elucidating genes/regions associated with a pleiotropic effect for breast and colorectal cancer risk, did not show a clear susceptibility locus for this phenotype. This raises the possibility that aggregation of these cancers within families may be due to chance co-occurrence of two common cancers. However, since germline variation in the region of ROBO1 was suggestive of an association with breast-colorectal cancer risk, and given mounting evidence for the role of ROBO1 as a tumor suppressor gene, further investigation of this association may be warranted.

29923122	TITLE	NUDT15 codon 139 is the best pharmacogenetic marker for predicting thiopurine-induced severe adverse events in Japanese patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a multicenter study
29923122	ABSTRACT	Background Despite NUDT15 variants showing significant association with thiopurine-induced adverse events (AEs) in Asians, it remains unclear which variants of NUDT15 or whether additional genetic variants should be tested to predict AEs. To clarify the best pharmacogenetic test to be used clinically, we performed association studies of NUDT15 variants and haplotypes with AEs, genome-wide association study (GWAS) to discover additional variants, and ROC analysis to select the model to predict severe AEs. Methods Overall, 2630 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were enrolled and genotyped for NUDT15 codon 139; 1291 patients were treated with thiopurines. diplotypes were analyzed in 970 patients, and GWASs of AEs were performed with 1221 patients using population-optimized genotyping array and imputation. Results We confirmed the association of NUDT15 p.Arg139Cys with leukopenia and alopecia (p = 2.20E-63, 1.32E-69, OR = 6.59, 12.1, respectively), and found a novel association with digestive symptoms (p = 6.39E-04, OR = 1.89). Time to leukopenia was significantly shorter, and when leukopenia was diagnosed, thiopurine doses were significantly lower in Arg/Cys and Cys/Cys than in Arg/Arg. In GWASs, no additional variants were found to be associated with thiopurine-induced AEs. Despite strong correlation of leukopenia frequency with estimated enzyme activities based on the diplotypes (r2 = 0.926, p = 0.0087), there were no significant differences in the AUCs of diplotypes from those of codon 139 to predict severe AEs (AUC = 0.916, 0.921, for acute severe leukopenia, AUC = 0.990, 0.991, for severe alopecia, respectively). Conclusions Genotyping of NUDT15 codon 139 was sufficient to predict acute severe leukopenia and alopecia in Japanese patients with IBD.

29923122	INTRO	Introduction The thiopurine drug 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and its pro-drug azathiopurine (AZA) are most commonly used for immunomodulatory treatments for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), represented by ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn's disease (CD), and intestinal Behcet's disease (BD). Several lines of evidence and a range of experience have shown that thiopurines are key drugs to maintain IBD remission. Furthermore, combination therapy using anti-TNF biologics with thiopurines reduces the formation of anti-drug antibodies and is expected to prevent the loss of response to biologics. Although substantial evidence of thiopurine's efficacy has been presented, it has been reported that several types of thiopurine-induced adverse events (AEs) were experienced in association with its use, especially during the induction period. The most common but serious AE is leukopenia, so doctors need to frequently monitor white blood cell (WBC) counts during the initiation period. Although it is not life-threatening, severe alopecia may also occur, and it results in a very serious event causing cosmetic problems requiring long recovery period. Leukopenia is considered to be one of the dose-dependent AEs. However, although the standard dose of thiopurines in Japan (AZA: 1-2 mg/kg/day) is almost half that in Europe (AZA: 2-2.5 mg/kg/day), the incidences of these two serious AEs in East Asian populations are higher than that in Caucasians. Genetic polymorphism of thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) causing TMPT deficiency is a well-established genetic marker of thiopurine-induced leukopenia in Caucasians. However, TPMT genotypes were shown not to be associated with leukopenia in the Japanese and TPMT deficiency fails to explain the higher incidence of adverse reactions in patients with IBD in East Asia. Therefore, it was considered that there are population-specific genetic variants associated with thiopurine intolerance. The first epoch-making discovery was reported by Yang et al., who specifically conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in Korean CD to reveal that a non-synonymous SNP, p.Arg139Cys (R139C), in nucleoside diphosphate-linked moiety X-type motif 15 (NUDT15) is very strongly associated with thiopurine-induced severe leukopenia. Subsequently, we reported a stronger association of this SNP with severe alopecia. After these reports, several replication or functional studies were performed. Moriyama et al. defined six major haplotype (*1-*6) combinations of four coding variants in exons 1 and 3; the combination of these haplotypes (diplotype) was significantly associated with tolerated 6-MP dose in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) among Hispanics and Asians. Diplotypes were also reportedly associated with the frequencies of leukopenia in adult patients with IBD in the Chinese. Despite the identification and clinical application of genetic variants of NUDT15 as pharmacogenetic markers of severe leukopenia and alopecia in IBD, the optimal approach in the clinical context with respect to genotyping of p.Arg139Cys or diplotyping of NUDT15 remains unclear. In the present study, to determine the optimal pharmacogenetic test for predicting thiopurine-induced AEs in a clinical context, we performed not only an association study of the NUDT15 variants and their haplotypes/diplotypes, but also a GWAS to discover additional variants associated with AEs and ROC analysis to select a model to predict severe AEs.
29923122	METHODS	Materials and methods Study design and participants The multicenter study for evaluation of NUDT15 genotyping efficiency to detect thiopurine-induced alopecia and leukopenia (MENDEL) was a multicenter, retrospective pharmacogenetic study. Staff at a total of 32 institutions conducted the study from December 2015 through September 2017. The eligible patients were diagnosed with CD, UC, or BD and had been treated with at least one of the following drugs: salazosulfapyridine (SASP), mesalamine (5-ASA), infliximab (IFX), adalimumab (ADA), 6-MP, and AZA. Patient diagnosis, sex, age at the time of enrollment, history of usage of these drugs, and adverse events were collected from the medical records. The definition of adverse events in this study was all clinical adverse events that triggered a modification in the usage of a drug or its discontinuation when the doctor considered the events to be associated with the drug. In total, 2630 IBD patients (CD 1049, UC 1522, and BD 60) were enrolled and genotyped for NUDT15 p.Arg139Cys. The study consisted of the following five association analyses: (analysis 1) association study of NUDT15 p.Arg139Cys with adverse events of other IBD drugs (analysis 2) replication and additional association analysis of NUDT15 codon 139 with all thiopurine-induced adverse events, (analysis 3) diplotype-based association study of NUDT15 with thiopurines, (analysis 4) genome-wide association study (GWAS) and replication analysis of previously reported SNPs with thiopurine-induced adverse events, and (analysis 5) ROC analysis to investigate the best model to predict thiopurine-induced severe AEs in Japanese patients with IBD (Fig. 1).  In the GWASs, we combined 255 additional samples from Tohoku University Hospital, most of which had previously been analyzed in the first replication study of NUDT15 in Japanese IBD. The protocol of the study was approved by the institutional review board at each institution; all adult patients provided written informed consent, and if the patients were minors (< 20 years old), parental consent was obtained. Genotyping of NUDT15 codon 139 Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes by standard phenol-chloroform precipitation. Three common genotypes of NUDT15 codon 139 were determined by the genotyping of rs116855232 (c.415C > T, Arg139Cys) using a TaqMan SNP genotyping assay, as previously described, at the central laboratory, LSI Medience Corporation (Tokyo, Japan). The outliers of three clusters (c.415 CC, CT, or TT) were analyzed by direct sequencing, by the same method as described below. Direct sequencing of NUDT15 coding regions Exons 1, 2, and 3 of NUDT15 were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis Sanger sequencing methods. Amplification primers are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Each 10 muL PCR amplification reaction contained 4 ng of gDNA, 1.2 pmol each primer, and 5 muL of BigDye  Direct PCR Master Mix. The reactions were amplified using a DNA Engine PTC-200 (MJ Research, NV, USA). The PCR conditions were as follows: initial holding at 95  C for 10 min, 35 cycles of denaturing at 9  C for 3 s, annealing at 62  C for 10 s, and extension at 68  C for 30 s, and post-extension at 72  C for 2 min. Each 10 muL sequencing reaction contained 7 muL of PCR product, 2 muL of BigDye  Direct Sequencing Master Mix, and 1 muL of BigDye  Direct M13 Fwd or M13 Rev sequencing primer. After initial incubation at 37  C for 15 min and 80  C for 2 min, cycling conditions were as follows: 96  C for 1 min, and then 25 cycles of sequencing at 96  C for 10 s, 50  C for 5 s, and 60  C for 75 s. At completion of the sequencing reaction, the sequencing products were purified using the BigDye XTerminator  Purification Kit. Electrophoresis was performed on an Applied Biosystems  3500xL Genetic Analyzer with POP-7  Polymer. Genome-wide SNP genotyping and imputation Genome-wide SNP genotypes were determined using Japonica array. For quality control (QC), SNPs with call rates < 97% or with a malformed genotype cluster according to SNPolisher program (Thermofisher) as well as samples with genotyping rates < 97%, samples of cryptic relatives (PI_HAT > 0.5), or samples that were identified as outliers upon plotting of the first two components of principal component analysis were excluded from the GWASs. Untyped genotypes were imputed in the GWAS samples with the haplotype reference panel of 2,036 individuals from Japan (2KJPN panel, which includes > 20 million SNVs). QC-passed SNPs were prephased using EAGLE (v 2.4) with the default settings. Phased genotypes were imputed with IMPUTE4 (v 1.0) using the 2KJPN panel as follows: Ne 20000 buffer 500, and data for 24,344,327 variants were obtained. SNVs with low imputation quality (with a posterior genotype probability of < 0.8 for each genotype or with info score < 0.5 for each variant), low call rate of < 0.97, minor allele frequency of < 0.01 or 0.05 (depends on the number of cases, 0.01 for GWASs of > 50 cases, 0.05 for GWASs of low-frequency AEs or conditional GWASs on rs116855232), and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) p < 1 x 10-6 were excluded. Further analysis was performed using genotype data from > 5 million SNVs from 1,221 Japanese IBD cases. Haplotype and diplotype phasing Diplotypes, namely, combinations of haplotypes in each individual, were inferred from the genotype information of the NUDT15 locus by applying a statistical phasing approach. For the samples from the MENDEL study, the genotypes at the NUDT15 locus obtained by Japonica array combined with the results obtained by exon 1-3 sequencing were phased by EAGLE (v 2.4). For the 2,036 samples from the general population (ToMMo cohort), the variants of the NUDT15 locus were discovered from the mapped reads of whole-genome sequencing with the HaplotypeCaller program in GATK and the resultant genotypes were phased with EAGLE. We followed the six major haplotype definitions (*1-*6) by Moriyama et al., and we defined haplotypes with three additional variants reported recently, p.Arg34Thr, p.Lys35Glu, and p.Gly17_Val18del, as *7, *8, and *9 following Moriyama's nomenclatures (Supplementary Fig. S1). Statistical analysis Categorical variables of clinical phenotypes were compared using Fisher's exact test. Associations of genotype frequencies with adverse events were analyzed by Cochran-Armitage trend analysis, while those of allele frequencies were analyzed by Chi-squared test. GWASs were evaluated using logistic regression with gender as a covariate using the PLINK v 1.90 software. SNPs with a p value < 1 x 10-8 were considered to have genome-wide significance, while those with a p value < 1 x 10-6 were considered to be nominally significant. SNPs located within 250 kbp of one another were considered to be in one region. Regional association plots were generated using the LocusZoom application. We generated a conditional logistic model with pairs of each SNP and rs116855232 (NUDT15 p.Arg139Cys) to determine whether one or more causal SNPs might explain the observed association. p values are interpretable as the residual variation explained by the SNP, conditional on the inclusion of rs116855232. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed using the R package pROC. All statistical analyses, except genome-wide logistic regression, were performed using the R software (v 3.4.4) (http://www.r-project.org/).
29923122	FIG	Flow of the analysis in this study. In total, 2630 patients with IBD were enrolled. All the patients were genotyped for NUDT15 codon 139. The number of patients exposed to thiopurines was 1291; additional genetic analyses were performed on 995 of these 1291 patients. This study consisted of five analyses: (analysis 1) association study of NUDT15 p.Arg139Cys with adverse events of other IBD drugs; (analysis 2) association analysis of NUDT15 codon 139 with thiopurine-induced adverse events; (analysis 3) diplotype-based association study of NUDT15 with thiopurines; (analysis 4) GWAS of thiopurine-induced adverse events; (analysis 5) ROC analysis to investigate the best model to predict thiopurine-induced severe AEs in Japanese patients with IBD Time to leukopenia and the doses of AZA according to the genotype of NUDT15 codon 139. a Time to leukopenia after starting treatment with thiopurines is plotted in terms of the genotype. Average time to leukopenia in patients with the Cys/Cys and Arg/Cys genotypes was significantly shorter than that for those with the Arg/Arg genotype. b Doses of thiopurines at the time when severe leukopenia was diagnosed were plotted. The 6-MP dose was adjusted to AZA equivalents by multiplying by 2.08. The dose of the patients carrying the p.Arg139Cys allele was significantly lower than that of the patients with Arg/Arg. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.005 Manhattan plots for results of the discovery and conditional GWASs for thiopurine-induced leukopenia and alopecia in Japanese individuals.

29923122	RESULTS	Results Association analyses of the genotypes of NUDT15 codon139 with thiopurine-induced AEs Thiopurine-induced digestive symptoms were significantly associated with Arg139Cys Of 2630 enrolled patients, three patients were excluded due to insufficient clinical data or an ethnicity issue (non-Japanese). Finally, a total of 2627 patients were included in analysis 1; the patient characteristics and genotype frequencies of NUDT15 codon 139 are summarized in Supplementary Table 2. We confirmed the strong and significant associations of NUDT15 p.Arg139Cys with AEs derived from thiopurines (p = 1.55E-36, OR = 4.13). However, AEs from four other IBD drugs were not significantly associated (Supplementary Table 3). A total of 1291 patients had a history of thiopurine usage, and 460 patients had discontinued or modified their usage of thiopurine due to AEs. The breakdown of AEs is summarized in Supplementary Table 4. No significant differences in the frequencies of each type of AE were observed between the diseases. As previously reported, we confirmed the strong associations of NUDT15 p.Arg139Cys with leukopenia and alopecia (p = 2.20E-63 and 1.32E-69, OR = 6.59 and 12.1, respectively), and we newly identified its significant association with thiopurine-induced digestive symptoms (p = 6.39E-04, OR = 1.89) (Table 1).  Time to leukopenia is significantly shorter in Arg/Cys and Cys/Cys than in Arg/Arg The data of the time to leukopenia (WBC < 3000/muL) were available in 211 of 236 patients who experienced leukopenia. The average time to leukopenia in the patients with the Cys/Cys or Arg/Cys genotype was significantly shorter than that in Arg/Arg (33.6 +- 17.5, 365 +- 573, 575 +- 781 days, p = 3.51E-02, 1.45E-05, respectively) (Fig. 2a). The doses of thiopurines at the time when severe leukopenia was diagnosed were 54.6 +- 19.1 mg/day in Arg/Cys and 39.4 +- 3.1 mg/day in Cys/Cys, which were significantly lower than 69.1 +- 28.1 mg/day in Arg/Arg (p = 2.46E-02 and 8.50E-06, respectively) (Fig. 2b).  Rare genotype of Cys/His is a risk for acute severe leukopenia, but not for alopecia The results of logistic regression analysis of severe AEs with all genotypes of codon 139 including rare histidine allele are summarized in Table 2. In comparison with the wild-type genotype (Arg/Arg), the odds ratios for acute severe leukopenia were higher in the order of Arg/Cys, Cys/His, and Cys/Cys (OR = 13.4, 318, and 807, respectively), while those for severe alopecia were higher in the order of Arg/Cys and Cys/Cys (OR = 106 and 8421, respectively). Arg/His was not a risk for AEs, while Cys/His was a risk for acute severe leukopenia (WBC < 2000/muL, < 8 weeks) but not for severe alopecia.  Association analyses of NUDT15 haplotypes/diplotypes with leukopenia and alopecia Rare non-synonymous variants were newly identified in the Japanese population By direct sequencing of exons 1, 2, and 3 of the NUDT15 gene, we identified in Japanese the rare haplotype *9 containing the p.Gly17_Val18del variant, which had previously been reported only in a non-Asian population. No other additional novel functional variants were identified. In addition, we analyzed NUDT15 regions of 2KJPN using the whole-genome sequencing results of a residential cohort of 2036 Japanese. Haplotype *9 was also found in 2KJPN, and we identified two novel haplotypes containing p.Met1Thr (loss of start codon) and p.Gly47Arg. All of these haplotype structures and frequencies are summarized in Supplementary Fig. S1. Rare haplotypes *7 and *8 reported previously were not found in our samples or the 2KJPN data set. Estimated enzyme activities based on the diplotypes were significantly associated with the frequencies of leukopenia Leukopenia and alopecia frequencies in each phased diplotype are summarized in Table 3. To evaluate the associations of diplotypes with AEs, we categorized them into the five groups according to the estimated enzyme activities. Frequencies of leukopenia (WBC < 3000/muL) were 10.2% in the normal and normal (NN) group, 17.9% in the NI (normal and intermediate) group, 30.7% in the normal and low (NL) group, 60.0% in the IL group, and 94.3% in the LL group. There was a strong correlation of the frequencies of leukopenia (WBC < 3000/muL) with estimated enzyme activities (r2 = 0.926, p = 0.0087), but not of acute severe leukopenia or severe alopecia.  Only NUDT15 was significantly associated with severe leukopenia and alopecia A significant association signal at chromosome 13 was observed in the results of GWAS for thiopurine-induced leukopenia and alopecia; the top hit SNP was rs116855232, NUDT15 Arg139Cys (Supplementary Table 5, Fig. 3a, c, Supplementary Figs. S2, S3a). The associations of rs116855232 with these two kinds of AEs were so strong that we performed conditional GWAS on rs116855232. Candidate regions showing nominal significance are summarized in Supplementary Table 6. All associations with leukopenia and alopecia observed in the first GWAS disappeared in the conditional analysis in leukopenia (Fig. 3b, d, Supplementary Fig. S3b). In the newly identified candidates, there were no non-synonymous functional variants.  From the GWAS results, we picked up the variants that were previously reported to be associated with thiopurine-induced leukopenia. ABCC4 Glu757Lys showed an association with leukopenia, and rs2834826 located upstream of RUNX1 showed an association in the conditional analysis on NUDT15 Arg139Cys. TPMT Tyr240Cys (TPMT*3C) was not associated with leukopenia, as previously reported in East Asians including the Japanese (Supplementary Table 7). We also performed GWAS for other thiopurine-induced AEs, pancreatitis, infection, digestive symptoms, liver dysfunction, skin symptoms, and fever (Supplementary Fig. S4). Candidate regions are summarized in Supplementary Table 5. rs4437130, located upstream of the CTCN4 (contactin 4) gene, and rs62561366, located upstream of PTCH1 (patched 1), were nominally associated with thiopurine-induced pancreatitis (Supplementary Fig. S5). In addition, rs12035735 in the intron of LRRC8D (leucine-rich repeat-containing 8 family, member D) was nominally associated with digestive symptoms. No significant genetic association with other AEs was observed. Genotyping of NUDT15 codon 139 is the best way to predict severe leukopenia and alopecia No additional SNPs were found in the conditional GWAS; therefore, we included the genotype of NUDT15 codon 139 or NUDT15 haplotype, ABCC4, and RUNX1 in the logistic regression models to predict thiopurine-induced severe leukopenia and alopecia. To compare the genotyping of codon 139 with other models, AUCs of each model to predict the AEs were evaluated. The AUC of the NUDT15 haplotype was significantly better to predict leukopenia (WBC < 3000/muL) than the model of NUDT15 codon 139 only (AUC = 0.706 and 0.722, p = 0.013, respectively) (Table 4, Supplementary Fig. S6). However, the AUC of codon 139 only was better than the haplotype to predict acute severe leukopenia (AUC = 0.921 and 0.916, respectively) and severe alopecia (AUC = 0991 and 0.990, respectively). The models containing ABCC4 and/or RUNX1 showed better AUCs; however, there were no significant differences between the model of only codon 139 and other models to predict severe AEs.  Moreover, we made eight additional models and performed ROC analyses to investigate the binary cut-off values of the codon 139 model and the haplotype models. Similar to the results of the logistic regression models, the best AUCs were diplotype_A or B models (cutoff as negative = *1*1 or *1*1*, *1*4, *1*5, *1*6, sensitivity = 0.594 and 0.566, specificity = 0.787 and 0.816, AUC = 0.691 and 0.691, respectively) to predict mild-to-severe leukopenia (WBC < 3000). The best AUCs were the Codon139_B model for severe leukopenia and acute severe leukopenia (cutoff as negative = Arg/Arg and Arg/His, sensitivity = 0.806 and 0.923, specificity = 0.790 and 0.780, and AUC = 0.798 and 0.852, respectively), and it was the Codon139_D model for severe alopecia (cutoff as positive = Cys/Cys, sensitivity = 0.919, specificity = 0.999, and AUC = 0.959) (Supplementary Table 8).

29923122	DISCUSS	Discussion In this study, we first replicated the association of NUDT15 Arg139Cys with thiopurine-induced leukopenia and alopecia, and found a novel association with digestive symptoms using a large case-control dataset from more than 30 institutions in Japan. By direct sequencing analysis and reanalysis of 2KJPN data in silico, three rare non-synonymous variants of NUDT15 were newly identified in the Japanese population. We performed pharmacogenetic GWAS of thiopurine-induced AEs using a population-optimized genotyping array and imputation; the obtained results suggested that the effect of genetic background was observed only in leukopenia and alopecia. Finally, we evaluated several predictive models; the simple model based on only NUDT15 codon 139 was found to be sufficient to predict severe leukopenia and alopecia in the Japanese. We collected DNA samples associated with cases of AEs caused by IBD drugs from all over Japan. During the study of the TaqMan assay for NUDT15 p.Arg139Cys, we identified the existence of p.Arg139His; it was rare but not negligible for the assay. Therefore, we performed an association study of NUDT15 codon 139 with AEs from several IBD drugs, and we confirmed that the association was observed only for thiopurine-induced AEs, leukocytopenia and alopecia. In addition, we newly identified the association of p.Arg139Cys with thiopurine-induced digestive symptoms. The digestive symptoms were mostly nausea or vomiting, which are considered as allergic reactions to thiopurines. However, the nausea may have heterogeneous etiologies; NUDT15 deficiency-induced leukopenia may cause nausea. It is difficult to clarify the etiology of nausea and determine that the symptoms are caused directly by p.Arg139Cys. However, we confirmed the association of digestive symptoms even after excluding all leukopenia cases [6.8% in Arg/Arg and 14.0% in Arg/Cys, p = 6.20E-03, OR = 2.22 (1.28-3.86)]; this may be one line of evidence, suggesting that NUDT15 variants are directly associated with digestive symptoms. Moriyama et al. defined six major haplotype (*1-*6) combinations of four coding variants in exons 1 and 3; moreover, recently, three additional variants in exon 1 were reported and we defined the additional haplotypes including these variants as *7, *8, and *9. Of these haplotypes, NUDT15 p.G17_V18del (*9) was only observed in those of European and African ancestry. In this study, we found two *9 carriers: one in the MENDEL study (diplotype *1/*9) and the other in the 2KJPN cohort (diplotype *2/*9). This is the first report describing the identification of p.G17_V18del in a Japanese population. In addition, we found two additional variants, p.Met1Thr (loss of start codon) and Gly47Arg, and haplotypes carrying these variants (haplotypes defined as *10 and *11, respectively) in 2KJPN whole-genome sequencing data (Supplementary Fig. S1). The incidence of AEs in each diplotype, the combination of haplotypes in each individual, is more important information to predict the AEs in a clinical setting. A recent report described associations of leukopenia with the NUDT15 diplotype in Chinese patients with IBD. In that report, the frequency of leukopenia was clearly related to NUDT15 enzyme activity based on diplotypes. We observed similar results in diplotype analysis; namely, the diplotype-based estimated enzyme activities were significantly correlated with the frequencies of leukopenia. However, diplotypes with haplotypes carrying only exon 1 variants (*5, *6, and *9) were rare, and frequencies of severe AEs, acute severe leukopenia, or severe alopecia, in these diplotypes (*1*5, *1*6, *1*9, *2*5, and *3*5), were all 0%. Therefore, diplotype analysis will be helpful to predict mild leukopenia, but there is no additional effect to predict severe AEs. This is the first genome-wide pharmacogenetic association study of thiopurine-induced AEs in the Japanese, using a population-optimized array and imputation. JPA is specific for the Japanese population; we can easily obtain whole-genome imputation data by imputing JPA results in combination with a large number of haplotypes of more than 2000 individuals with Japanese ancestry (2KJPN). The top hit of GWASs with leukopenia and alopecia was rs116855232 (NUDT15 p.Arg139Cys). JPA does not contain the probes for rs116855232, so the genotypes were imputed. The results were compatible with our association results obtained by TaqMan assays. It demonstrated the efficacy of whole-genome imputation, population-optimized array, and imputation with population-matched reference data. Because the associations of rs116855232 with leukopenia and alopecia were robust and very strong, we performed conditional GWASs on rs116855232 to find additional variants besides NUDT15. No other additional variants were significantly associated with these two kinds of AEs. Several genes were reported to be associated with leukopenia before and after the discovery of an association with NUDT15. TPMT, thiopurine S-methyltransferase, is well known to inactivate thiopurines by methylation and its genetic variation is one of the few pharmacogenetic predictors used in a clinical setting in the Caucasian population. TPMT*3C was reported to be significantly associated with acute leukopenia in Korean IBD, but no association was observed in the previous reports on studies in the Japanese. In this study, there was no association of TPMT*3C with leukopenia in our large-scale Japanese IBD data, supporting the previous results in the Japanese. ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 4 (ABCC4), also known as multidrug-resistance protein 4 (MRP4), is associated with thiopurine metabolism; its genetic variant rs3765534 (p.Glu757Lys) was reported to be associated with leukopenia in the Japanese. Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) was reported to play an important role in hematopoiesis, and rs2834826 located upstream of this gene was found to be significantly associated with leukopenia in Korean IBD. We confirmed associations of these two variants in this study, but these effect sizes were relatively small. In the Caucasian population, thiopurine-induced pancreatitis was reported to be associated with the HLA-DQA1*02:01-HLA-DRB1*07:01 haplotype. In our results, there was no signal at HLA regions at all. Two candidate regions were observed. One is located upstream of CNTN4; the variant located near this gene was reported to be a risk factor for pancreatic cancer. The other is located upstream of PTCH1, coding the receptor for sonic hedgehog. The sonic hedgehog signaling pathway was reported to be associated with the development of chronic pancreatitis. However, how these SNPs affect the function or expression of these genes remained unknown, and all of the GWASs of AEs except leukopenia were performed with a very small sample size. Further investigation with larger sample set will be needed (Supplementary Table 9). AEs caused by NUDT15 deficiency are very problematic in a clinical setting; severe leukopenia can be a critical event and severe alopecia affects the QOL of patients for a prolonged period. Not only could avoiding these NUDT15-derived AEs help the patients with a risk genotype of NUDT15 to not encounter severe AEs, but also for other patients, thiopurines will be more acceptable by relieving the anxiety associated with severe AEs. Therefore, testing the genotype or diplotype of NUDT15 is promising for clinical applications to predict thiopurine toxicity in Asian and Hispanic populations. Considering NUDT15 testing in a clinical context, whether to test the genotype or the diplotype is a major issue. Genotyping of codon 139 is not so difficult, and just one or two (p.Arg139His) assays are required. However, to determine the diplotype, combined analysis with two variants in exon 1 is required. In our results, the testing of NUDT15 codon 139 (p.Arg139Cys/His) showed higher AUCs than detecting the diplotype of NUDT15 to predict severe leukopenia and alopecia. However, Chao et al. reported that the predictive sensitivity of NUDT15 p.Arg139Cys for leukopenia was 49.2% in their Chinese IBD cohort, but to determine the diplotype by detecting haplotypes, *5 and *6 could increase the sensitivity to 55.4%. These results suggest a discrepancy, but it may be caused by inconsistent definitions of leukopenia used. In the study, the definition of leukopenia was a WBC count of < 3500/muL, which is higher than in other reports. In our study, to predict conditions ranging from mild to severe leukopenia (WBC < 3000/muL), detection of the diplotype showed a better AUC than detection of the genotype of codon 139, which is compatible with the findings described in their report. It is important to decide how severe adverse events need to be distinguished by a clinical examination. Depending on the purpose of thiopurine usage, the target should differ among the diseases. In IBD patients, thiopurines are used in maintenance therapy. For clinical application, it is sufficient for the test to avoid severe leukopenia and alopecia. Therefore, testing of codon 139 would be the optimal clinical examination considering the time, effort, and costs associated with genotyping. If the WBC count needs to be tightly controlled, the test for detecting the diplotype should be considered. It has been reported that NUDT15 converted thiopurine active metabolites 6-thio-GTP and 6-thio-dGTP to 6-thio-GMP and 6-thio-dGMP. The variants of NUDT15 were shown to exert lower enzyme activity causing a higher thiopurine active metabolite level, thereby resulting in dose-dependent AEs such as thiopurine-induced leukopenia and alopecia. In our results, the doses of thiopurines at the time when severe leukopenia was diagnosed were lower and the time to leukopenia was shorter in the patients with the genotypes of Arg/Cys and Cys/Cys. These results suggest that AEs associated with NUDT15 deficiency were dose-dependent, and the optimal dose must differ in each genotype. No patients with the Arg/His genotype experienced severe leukopenia, but both the two patients with the Cys/His genotype experienced severe or mild leukopenia at the AZA dose of 25 mg/day. Previously, we reported that the average maintenance doses of thiopurines are 1.03 mg/kg/day in patients with the Arg/Arg genotype and 0.574 mg/kg/day in those with the Arg/Cys genotype. We analyzed the correlation between the 6-MP doses and time to leukopenia in the patients with the Cys/Cys genotype (Supplementary Fig. S7). There was a significant correlation in the log linear model (r2 = 0.578, p = 0.0174). Two patients with the Cys/Cys genotype experienced mild or severe leukopenia at the dose of 6 MP of 5 mg/day, but the times to leukopenia were 42 days (mild leukopenia without alopecia) and 101 days (severe leukopenia with severe alopecia). The former patient was able to continue being treated with 6 MP for 1029 days by adjusting the dose from 2 to 5 mg/day. From these results, there is a possibility that the patients with the Cys/Cys genotype can start 6 MP at 1-2 mg/day. However, considering the purpose of thiopurines in IBD, there is a question about why the patients need to try thiopurines and thus a risk of severe AEs. By taking into account these results, we can make provisional recommendations regarding the safe initial dose of thiopurines. These doses are AZA at 50 mg/day or 6 MP at 30 mg/day in Japanese adult IBD patients with the genotype of Arg/Arg or Arg/His, AZA at 25 mg/day or 6 MP at 10-15 mg/day in patients with Arg/Cys, 6 MP at 5-10 mg/day in patients with Cys/His, and thiopurines are contraindicated in patients with the Cys/Cys genotype (Supplementary Table 10). There are several limitations in this study. First, this was a retrospective multicenter study, so the methods of thiopurine usage and monitoring of AEs varied. In particular, time to leukopenia depended on how frequently WBC counts were examined. Second, the sample size of AEs except for leukopenia and alopecia was very small, and the results of GWASs for other AEs such as pancreatitis were very limited. Finally, the analysis was performed only in the Japanese patients with IBD. Therefore, the selection of predictive models and recommendation of the optimal doses were applicable only to Japanese patients with IBD. In conclusion, a multicenter pharmacogenetic study revealed that the genotyping of NUDT15 codon 139 is the best way to predict severe leukopenia and alopecia in Japanese patients with IBD. We provided provisional recommendations on safe initial doses of thiopurines according to the genotype of the patient. However, further prospective study is required to evaluate these recommendations.

22899653	TITLE	Influence of common genetic variation on lung cancer risk: meta-analysis of 14 900 cases and 29 485 controls
22899653	ABSTRACT	Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified common genetic variants at 5p15.33, 6p21-6p22 and 15q25.1 associated with lung cancer risk. Several other genetic regions including variants of CHEK2 (22q12), TP53BP1 (15q15) and RAD52 (12p13) have been demonstrated to influence lung cancer risk in candidate- or pathway-based analyses. To identify novel risk variants for lung cancer, we performed a meta-analysis of 16 GWASs, totaling 14 900 cases and 29 485 controls of European descent. Our data provided increased support for previously identified risk loci at 5p15 (P = 7.2 x 10-16), 6p21 (P = 2.3 x 10-14) and 15q25 (P = 2.2 x 10-63). Furthermore, we demonstrated histology-specific effects for 5p15, 6p21 and 12p13 loci but not for the 15q25 region. Subgroup analysis also identified a novel disease locus for squamous cell carcinoma at 9p21 (CDKN2A/p16INK4A/p14ARF/CDKN2B/p15INK4B/ANRIL; rs1333040, P = 3.0 x 10-7) which was replicated in a series of 5415 Han Chinese (P = 0.03; combined analysis, P = 2.3 x 10-8). This large analysis provides additional evidence for the role of inherited genetic susceptibility to lung cancer and insight into biological differences in the development of the different histological types of lung cancer.
22899653	INTRO	INTRODUCTION Lung cancer is a major cause of cancer death worldwide accounting for over 1 million deaths each year. The major lung cancer histologic subtypes (small cell and non-small cell) have different clinicopathological characteristics reflective of differences in carcinogenesis. While lung cancer is largely caused by tobacco smoking, there is increasing evidence for the role of inherited genetic factors in disease etiology. Notably, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of lung cancer have robustly demonstrated that polymorphic variation at 5p15.33 (TERT/CLPTM1L), 6p21.33 (BAT3/MSH5) and 15q25.1 (CHRNA5/CHRNA3/CHRNB4) influences lung cancer risk in European populations. Additionally, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 22q12 and the 15q15.2 locus containing the TP53-binding protein 1 gene have been associated with lung cancer risk. Three additional susceptibility regions at 13q12.12, 22q12.2 and 3q28 have been identified in GWASs on Asian populations, but to date these regions have not been implicated in lung cancer risk in individuals of European ancestry. Given the biological differences across lung cancer subtypes, histology- and smoking-specific associations have been conducted. Analyses have shown that SNP rs2736100 (TERT) is primarily associated with adenocarcinoma risk and variation in RAD52 at 12p13 with squamous cell carcinoma risk. Significant heterogeneity by smoking status and age of onset has been shown for SNPs at the 15q25 locus harboring nicotinic acetylcholine receptor genes. The statistical power of individual GWAS has been limited by the modest effect sizes of genetic variants, the need to establish stringent thresholds of statistical significance and financial constraints on the numbers of variants that could be studied. Additionally, due to sample size limitations, few comprehensive histology and smoking history subgroup analyses have been performed in individual GWAS. Meta-analysis of existing GWAS data therefore offers the opportunity to discover additional disease loci harboring common variants associated with lung cancer risk and explore the variability in genetic effects according to disease heterogeneity. In this study, we conducted a pooled analysis of data from 16 GWASs of lung cancer providing data on 14 900 cases and 29 485 controls of European ancestry. We studied associations by histology, sex, smoking status, age of onset, stage and family history of lung cancer and explored the individual contribution of SNPs in previously identified risk loci. To explore how these genetic findings translate into non-European populations, we evaluated selected SNPs in a Han Chinese study of 2338 lung cancer cases and 3077 controls.
22899653	RESULTS	RESULTS A total of 14 900 lung cancer cases and 29 485 controls of European descent from 16 previously reported lung cancer GWASs undertaken by nine analytical centers were included in the meta-analysis (Table 1, Supplementary Material, Table S1 and Fig. S1). The meta-analysis was primarily based on pooling GWAS summary results from 318 094 SNPs featured on Illumina HumanHap 300 BeadChips arrays. For studies genotyped on HumanHap550 or 610Quad Illumina platforms, an additional 217 914 SNPs were available to inform our analysis.  Some degree of genomic over-dispersion (genomic inflation) is expected under a polygenic model even in the absence of population stratification and other technical artifacts, and the meta-analysis showed modest evidence of over-dispersion (lambda = 1.10) for the core 318 094 SNPs typed on Illumina HumanHap 300 BeadChips platform (Fig. 1, Supplementary Material, Fig. S2). Adjustment for a genomic inflation factor of 1.10 in this meta-analysis conservatively reduces the power to detect an association. The lambda normalized to 1000 cases and 1000 controls was only 1.005, when the approach proposed by Freedman et al. was applied.  SNPs mapping to the previously identified risk loci at 5p15, 6p21 and 15q25 provided the best evidence for an association with lung cancer (Supplementary Material, Tables S2 and S3 and Fig. 1). The strongest association was found for rs1051730, which maps to exon 5 of CHRNA3 at 15q25 (P = 2.2 x 10-63; Fig. 2G), and rs8034191 (r2 = 0.93, D' = 1 between the two SNPs, P = 9.5 x 10-59), which is located in the second intron of the AGPHD1 gene. Consistent with previous observations, the rs1051730 association was significant in smokers (P = 1.8 x 10-59) and not in never smokers (P = 0.06, Fig. 2, Supplementary Material, Fig. S3). The association also appeared slightly stronger in females than in males [respective odds ratios (ORs) 1.42 and 1.29, Phet = 0.02] and for late-stage rather than early-stage disease (respective ORs 1.39 and 1.28, Phet = 0.06).  Thirty-one additional SNPs localizing to 15q25.1 with a varied level of linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs1051730 (Supplementary Material, Table S4) showed a genome-wide significant association (Supplementary Material, Table S2). The third strongest evidence for association was observed for rs6495309 (P = 1.1 x 10-32), which maps the 3' downstream of CHRNB4 and shows weaker correlation with rs1051730 (r2 = 0.15; D' = 1.00; Fig. 2F). After adjusting for rs1051730, the effect estimate for rs6495309 was greatly attenuated (P = 4.0 x 10-5), while rs1051730 remained significant (P = 2.4 x 10-26; Fig. 3) when allele dosage for rs6495309 was included into a model. Two intronic variants of CHRNA5 (rs680244, effect allele T, OR = 0.90, P = 7.2 x 10-10, and rs6495306, effect allele G, OR = 0.91, P = 1.8 x 10-9) changed the direction of effect when controlling for rs1051730 (OR = 1.14 P = 1.4 x 10-8 and OR = 1.13, P = 4.1 x 10-8 for rs680244, effect allele T, and rs6495306, effect allele G, respectively, after controlling for allelic dosage). Conversely, an analysis adjusting for rs6495309 enhanced their effects consistently across studies (P = 9.2 x 10-31 and 5.1 x 10-32 for rs680244 and rs6495306, respectively). No other 15q25.1 variant showed a significant association when allelic dosages for rs1051730 and rs6495309 were included into the statistical model.  After imputation, the most significant association in the meta-analysis of GWAS data from individuals of European ancestry was shown by rs951266 (P = 2.8 x 10-62, Supplementary Material, Fig. S4), which maps to intron 2 of CHRNA5 and is in LD with both rs1051730 and rs16969968. Rs951266 also showed evidence for an association in the Han Chinese population (MAF = 0.04, P < 0.01). Several other rare imputed variants that do not directly correlate with the 15q25 variants identified in GWAS of European descendants (r2 < 0.05 and D' = 1) showed association with lung cancer risk in the Han Chinese population (Supplementary Material, Fig. S6). These variants map within or in close proximity to IREB2. As previously reported, two independent susceptibility variants, rs2736100 and rs401681, which annotate to TERT and CLPTM1L, were identified in the 5p15.33 region (Fig. 2A and B). Also consistent with previous findings, the risk associated with rs2736100 was largely confined to adenocarcinoma (P = 1.7 x 10-19). In contrast, rs401681 influenced the risk of all lung cancer histologies, but had its strongest effect on squamous cell carcinoma (OR = 0.84, P = 3.7 x 10-11) and large-cell carcinoma (OR = 0.78, P = 0.006). Both SNPs in the 5p15.33 locus had a stronger effect in never smokers (OR = 1.25 for rs2736100 and OR = 0.80 for rs401681) than in ever smokers (OR = 1.11, Phet = 0.04 for rs2736100 and OR = 0.88; Phet = 0.11 for rs401681). The rs2736100 association was stronger in women than in men (respective ORs = 1.21 and 1.12; Phet = 0.05) and in late-stage versus early-stage disease (respective ORs = 1.19 and 1.07; Phet = 0.05). Logistic regression including the allelic dosage of two independent SNPs (rs401681 and rs2736100) as covariates showed no support for additional independent associations at 5p15.33 (Fig. 3). Consistent with previous reports, rs2736100 and rs401681 both showed an association with lung cancer risk in Han Chinese (Supplementary Material, Fig. S5). In the meta-analysis of imputed genotypes, rs2853677, localizing to intron 2 of TERT, showed the strongest evidence for an association with adenocarcinoma (OR for the G allele = 1.33; P = 2.2 x 10-18) and rs465498, localizing to intron 10 of CLPTM1L, showed the strongest association with lung cancer overall (OR for the A allele = 1.15, P = 8.2 x 10-18; Supplementary Material, Fig. S4). Both variants showed correlations with the previously identified SNPs (r2 = 1.0 and D' = 1.0 between genotyped rs401681 and imputed rs465498 at CLPTM1L and r2 = 0.54 and D' = 0.80 between genotyped rs2736100 and imputed rs2853677 at TERT). The analysis of previously reported lung cancer risk locus at 6p21-6p22, which encompasses HLA, is complicated by an extended LD structure. The strongest 6p21-6p22 association was shown for rs3117582 (P = 2.3 x 10-14), which maps the 5' upstream of the DNA repair gene BAT3, and is in complete LD with rs3131379 in MSH5, a DNA mismatch repair gene. This association was stronger for squamous cell carcinoma (respective ORs for squamous carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, 1.30 and 1.12, Phet = 0.02; Fig. 2, Supplementary Material, Fig. S3). Logistic regression including the allelic dosage of rs3117582 did not identify any SNPs associated with lung cancer risk with genome-wide significance (Fig. 3). When markers were imputed, the strongest signal for squamous cell carcinoma in this region was observed for two correlated variants (r2 = 1.0, D' = 1.0; r2 = 0.76, D' = 0.93 with rs3117582 for both SNPs): rs2523546 (effect allele G, OR = 0.76, P = 1.1 x 10-10) and rs2523571 (effect allele T, OR = 0.76, P = 9.7 x 10-11) located in the 3'UTR region of HLA-B (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4). Excluding SNPs mapping to 5p15.33, 6p21-6p22 and 15q25.1, no SNP showed evidence for a genome-wide significant association with lung cancer risk (Fig. 1). Stratification of lung cancer cases by histology did, however, reveal associations with squamous cell carcinoma risk for the previously described risk locus at 12p13 and two potential novel disease loci at 9p21.3 and 2q32.1 (P < 5.0 x 10-7; Figs 1 and 2, Supplementary Material, Fig. S7). No evidence for association was noted for chromosome X variants in the gender subgroup analysis. Specifically, rs10849605, which maps within intron 1 of the DNA double-strand repair gene RAD52 in the 12p13.33 region, was inversely associated with lung cancer risk (effect allele T; OR = 0.92, P = 5.0 x 10-7). This association was particularly strong among smokers (OR = 0.92, P = 6.0 x 10-7) and cases with squamous (OR = 0.87; P = 6.0 x 10-8) and small-cell carcinoma (OR = 0.85, P = 2.0 x 10-6; Phet = 0.0002 across histologies; Fig. 2E, Supplementary Material, Fig. S3). This variant was not significantly associated with lung cancer risk overall or any histology group in the Han Chinese GWAS (Table 2, Supplementary Material, Fig. S5).  To further explore this region, we performed a meta-analysis of imputed variants from 15 GWASs from eight analytical centers on individuals of European ancestry. In this analysis, rs3748522, which maps to intron 1 of RAD52 and is in strong LD with rs10849605 (r2 = 0.90, D' = 1), provided the strongest association with squamous cell carcinoma (effect allele A, OR = 0.86, P = 3.4 x 10-8; Supplementary Material, Fig. S4). The strongest evidence for association at 9p21 was shown with rs1333040, which is located ~ 74 kb upstream of CDKN2B, within intron 12 of CDKN1B antisense RNA 1 or ANRIL (effect allele C, OR = 1.06, P = 9.4 x 10-5; Figs 1 and 2D). A subgroup analysis by histology revealed strong heterogeneity (Phet = 0.003) with the strongest association for squamous cell cancer (OR = 1.14, P = 2.9 x 10-7). Rs1333040 also showed an association with squamous cell carcinoma in the Han Chinese population (P = 0.03, Supplementary Material, Fig. S5). In the combined analysis of all data sets, this association attained genome-wide significance (P = 2.3 x 10-8; Table 2). In an analysis of imputed data across eight studies, the lowest P-value was shown for rs1537372 (effect allele G, OR = 1.14, P = 3.3 x 10-6) (r2 = 0.60, D' = 0.95 with rs1333040) located in the intron 14 of CDKN1B-AS/ANRIL (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4). The next strongest association with squamous cell carcinoma risk was shown for rs11683501 at 2q32.1 after adjustment for smoking (effect allele G, OR = 1.17, P = 1.6 x 10-7, Supplementary Material,Fig. S7). This SNP is located 3' downstream of the nucleoporin 35 kDa (NUP35) gene. Imputation did not identify any stronger association (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4), and rs11683501 did not show an association with risk in the Han Chinese population (Supplementary Material, Fig. S5). We additionally interrogated variation at 15q15.2, which has been previously identified as a determinant of lung cancer risk. In the meta-analysis, rs504417 showed the strongest association, but did not attain genome-wide significance (P = 1.2 x 10-6; Supplementary Material, Fig. S7). Finally, we evaluated the 3q28, 2q29, 13q12.12 and 22q12.2 regions previously identified in GWASs of Asian populations as risk factors for lung cancer. None of the SNPs (or their proxies) mapping to these loci showed evidence for an association in European populations (Supplementary Material, Table S5).

22899653	DISCUSS	DISCUSSION By pooling summary results from 16 GWASs, we have provided additional evidence for inherited genetic predisposition to lung cancer and have refined associations at the 5p15, 6p21-6p22, 12p13 and 15q25 risk loci. Furthermore, we have shown that 9p21.3 variation is a determinant of squamous cell lung cancer risk. 5p15.33 region Consistent with previous studies, our meta-analysis confirmed two independent signals at 5p15.33 (annotating TERT and CLPTM1L genes) as determinants of lung cancer risk impacting differentially on lung cancer histology. The rs2736100 variant in TERT was principally associated with adenocarcinoma risk and showed stronger effects in women, early-onset disease and never smokers where the proportion of adenocarcinoma cases is generally higher. Although indirect, the possibility that the association between rs2736100 and adenocarcinoma risk is mediated through an effect on TERT is supported by an observation of TERT amplification and mRNA overexpression in adenocarcinoma, as well as the inhibition of lung adenocarcinoma cell growth promoted by the suppression of hTERT expression. The CLPTM1L association appears stronger in squamous cell lung carcinoma and large-cell lung cancer, two histology groups strongly linked to tobacco smoking. This is consistent with the finding that a variant in CLPTM1L (rs402710, G) has been associated with high levels of DNA adducts caused by smoking. 6p21-6p22 region A role for the 6p21-6p22 locus in lung cancer development has been previously shown by some, but not all studies. This meta-analysis identified 61 SNPs at 6p21-6p22 showing a significant association with lung cancer risk. Most of these SNPs were highly correlated with rs3117582, which had the strongest effect for the squamous cell carcinoma. rs3117582 is located 73 bp 5' of the gene encoding BCL2-associated athanogene 6 (BAG6/BAT3), which belongs to a BAG domain containing a family of proteins that interact with Hsp70/Hsc70. BAT3/BAG6-deficient mice are embryonic lethal with defects in the development of the lung, brain and kidney. BAT3/BAG6 plays an essential role in p53-mediated apoptosis induced by genotoxic stress. rs3117582 is in perfect LD with rs3131379, which maps to intron 10 of the DNA mismatch repair mutS homolog 5 (Escherichia coli) (MSH5) gene. Both BAT3 and MSH5 are expressed in lung tissue and are strong potential candidates for being the functional basis for the association. Since the development of squamous cell lung cancer is strongly influenced by environmental exposure to carcinogens that cause DNA damage, it is highly plausible that genetic variation in the DNA repair mechanism and/or DNA-damage-induced apoptosis would play an etiologic role. 9p21.3 locus The 9p21.3 region encodes three tumor suppressor genes that play key roles in cell cycle inhibition, senescence and stress-induced apoptosis: CDKN2A/p16INK4A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors 2A), p14ARF (alternative transcript generated by alternative exon 1 of CDKN2A/p16INK4A) and CDKN2B/p15INK4B (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors 2B). CDKN2A/p16INK4A was originally identified as a melanoma susceptibility gene, but is inactivated in many tumors including lung cancer. 9p21.3 variants associated with lung cancer risk in our study are located 5' upstream of CDKN2B, within the intronic region of the CDKN2B antisense RNA (ANRIL/CDKN2B-AS). Recent studies have demonstrated 9p21.3 to be a susceptibility locus in many GWASs including on breast cancer, glioma, type 2 diabetes, endometriosis, coronary artery disease, intracranial aneurysm and glaucoma. Several splice variants with varied enhancer activity have been described for ANRIL, including GQ495921, GQ495919 and GQ495923, which are expressed in lung cancer cell lines. Multiple SNPs, including rs1333040 reported here, have been shown to be associated with ANRIL mRNA expression in peripheral blood. ANRIL recruits a polycomb repression complex (PRC2) to silence CDKN2B but not CDKN2A. The identified SNP rs1333040 correlates (0.7 < r2 < 0.8) with 24 variants located within or 3'UTR downstream of CDKN2B-AS. None of these variants are located within the coding sequence. However, the possibility that the identified variant is tagging a functional SNP located directly within the CDKN2A/p16INK4A, p14ARF or CDKN2B/p15INK4B genes cannot be excluded. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect that the SNPs we identified may have on ANRIL/CKDN2B-AS. 12p13.33 locus The 12p13 risk variants map within the RAD52 homolog gene which plays a role in DNA double-strand repair and homologous recombination. A role of the RAD52 in lung carcinogenesis was originally proposed from a candidate gene study reported by Danoy et al., a finding confirmed by a pathway-based analysis using GWAS data from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), UK, and the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) studies which robustly demonstrated an association for squamous lung cancer. The role of RAD52 in repairing double-strand breaks induced by tobacco smoking is supported by the association being confined to smokers. 15q25.1 region The present study has confirmed the smoking-related effect of 15q25 variation on lung cancer risk and has provided additional support for the existence of several independent disease loci within the CHRNA5/CHRNA3/CHRNB4 region. This is consistent with genotyping data which has shown several distinct signals for smoking behavior and lung cancer risk within this region. Saccone et al. described four distinct loci influencing smoking behavior at 15q25 with at least two of them (locus 1 annotated by rs1051730/rs16969968 and locus 3 annotated by rs588765) having independent effects on smoking behavior. The second locus annotated by rs6495308 was more strongly associated with heavy smoking. In contrast, the Oxford-GlaxoSmithKline study reported a secondary locus distinct from rs6495308. Our current study supports the existence of the two distinct signals defined by rs1051730/rs16969968 and rs6495309/rs6495308/rs2036534. Reciprocal attenuation of the effects for these two signals when allele dosage for an opposite variant is included into a model raises the possibility of an underlying haplotypic effect (r2 = 0.17, D' = 1.0 between these two SNPs) or an imperfect correlation with an unknown functional variant. We also observed an effect for rs680244/rs6495306 (r2 = 1.0, D' = 1.0 with rs588765 for both) in our meta-analysis, which remained significant at a genome-wide level when controlled for rs6495309 and strongly diminished when controlled for both rs1051730 and rs6495309. This suggests that the rs588765/rs680244/rs6495306 effect on lung cancer risk is not independent. Similar to the earlier observation from Saccone et al., these variants had opposite effects when adjusted for rs1051730, which may reflect a haplotypic organization in which the rs1051730 allele increases risk while other associated SNPs decrease the risk. Impact of variants on squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma Our study confirmed a different genetic background for the two major histological subtypes of lung cancer:squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Although the role of the CHRNA5/CHRNA3/CHRNB4 locus at 15q25 and, to some extent, the CLPTM1L locus at 5p15.33 appeared independent from the histology type, all other identified genomic regions showed strong heterogeneity by histology, suggesting different genetic etiologies for these lung cancer subtypes. The significance of cell cycle control (CDKN2A/ARF/CDKN2B/ANRIL), DNA damage response and DNA repair genes (RAD52 and BAT3/MSH5) in squamous cell carcinoma is consistent with the notion of a particularly strong effect of smoking on the development of this histological subtype and suggests candidate drug targets that may have clinical utility. The power of the meta-analysis to identify 5p15.33, 6p21-6p22 and 15q25.1 risk SNPs and loci was over 90%, making it unlikely that additional lung cancer susceptibility variants of similar magnitude and allele frequencies can be identified by simply increasing sample size in Europeans. In contrast, the power of our study was limited to detect rarer variants (i.e. MAFs < 0.05) and common variants of a small effect size (i.e. RR <= 1.05) and/or with modest effects confined to a specific histology (Supplementary Material, Fig. S8). The present study was also limited to the genetic variants tagged by the genotyping arrays used. Several novel variants were identified within 5p15.33, 6p21-6p22, 9p21.3, 12p13.33 and 15q25.1 through imputation. The imputed variants correlated with the previously genotyped SNPs in individuals of European descendents, suggesting no additional independent signal within known loci to be identified. However, the replication of imputed variants by direct genotyping would be helpful to completely characterize the strength of effects of these SNPs. In summary, by pooling results from 16 GWASs, we have been able to comprehensively assay the relationship between common genetic variation and lung cancer risk. Furthermore, we have been able to demonstrate a novel relationship between 9p21.3 variation and squamous cell lung carcinoma. This study provides valuable insights into the pathogenesis of lung cancer, indicating that there is etiological heterogeneity to disease development which is influenced by inherited genetic variation. The identification of additional risk loci is likely to require genotyping larger series using arrays formatted to capture variants poorly tagged by current platforms.
22899653	METHODS	MATERIAL AND METHODS The study was conducted under the auspices of the Transdisciplinary Research In Cancer of the Lung (TRICL) Research Team, which is a part of the Genetic Associations and MEchanisms in ONcology (GAME-ON) consortium, and associated with the International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO). Description of studies The meta-analysis was based on summary data from 16 previously reported lung cancer GWASs undertaken by nine analytical centers providing genotype data on 14 900 lung cancer cases and 29 485 controls of European descent: the MD Anderson Cancer Center lung cancer study; cases from the Liverpool Lung Project and control individuals from the UK Blood Service collections (UKBS); the UK lung cancer GWAS from the Institute for Cancer Research including lung cancer cases from the Genetic Lung Cancer Predisposition Study (GELCAPS) and controls from the 1958 Birth Cohort; the deCODE Genetics lung cancer study; the Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft Deutscher Forschungszentren (HGF) lung cancer GWAS; the lung cancer study from Canada (University of Toronto and Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute); the Harvard lung cancer study; the NCI lung cancer GWAS including the Environment and Genetics in Lung Cancer Etiology (EAGLE) study, the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC), the Prostate, Lung, Colon, Ovary Screening Trial (PLCO) and the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort (CPS-II); the IARC lung cancer GWAS including Central Europe GWAS, the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) cohort lung cancer GWAS, the HUNT2/Tromso 4 study, lung cancer GWAS from France and the lung cancer study from Estonia (Table 1; Supplementary Material, Material and methods). All participants provided informed written consent. All studies were reviewed and approved by institutional ethics review committees at the involved institutions. In each of these studies, SNP genotyping had been performed using Illumina HumanHap 300 BeadChips, HumanHap550 or 610 Quad arrays. Further details about selection criteria, cancer diagnosis, genotyping and quality control in each study are provided in the Supplementary Material, Material and methods. Lung cancer diagnosis in most studies was based on histopathology or cytology but in a minority on clinical history and imaging. The Chinese lung cancer GWAS included 2338 lung cancer cases and 3077 controls from the Nanjing and Beijing Lung Cancer Studies genotyped using Affymetrix Human SNP Array 6.0 chips (Supplementary Material, Material and methods). The Nanjing and Beijing Lung Cancer Studies provided summary data on the top SNPs for overall lung cancer risk and risk by specific histology. The selected loci were 5p15.33 (1.20-1.61 Mb), 6p22.3-6p21.31 (22.0-36.5 Mb), 15q25.1 (76.1-77.2 Mb), 18q2.3 (40.0-21.5 Mb), 12p13.33 (0.54-1.54 Mb), 2q32.1 (183.4-184.5 Mb) and 9p21.3 (21.66-22.2 Mb) (NCBI Build 36). Statistical methods Study-specific analysis of GWAS data Associations between SNP genotypes and lung cancer risk were evaluated under a log-additive model of inheritance. Additionally, we explored dominant, recessive and co-dominant models. Each study center provided summary statistics from two models: (i) unconditional logistic regression adjusted for sex, age at diagnosis or age at recruitment (5-year age intervals), country/study center where appropriate and significant principal components for population stratification and (ii) additionally adjusted for smoking status coded as categorical variable never/current/former. Analyses stratified by histology (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large-cell carcinoma and small-cell carcinoma), sex, age at diagnosis for cases or recruitment for controls (<=50 and >50 years), smoking status (current, former, never), tumor stage (I-IV) and family history of lung cancer in a first-degree relative were performed (Supplementary Material, Table S1). Both the UK studies did not contribute data to the smoking analysis, since this information was not available for controls. In addition to the above analyses, each centre provided lung cancer risk estimates for 15q25, 6p21 and 5p15 loci after controlling for allelic dosage for the most significantly associated SNP(s) within the locus. For the 15q25 locus, the statistical model included rs1051730 and/or rs6495309 allelic dosages as covariates; for the 6p21 locus, rs3117582 allelic dosage and for the 5p15 locus allelic, dosages for rs401681 and/or rs2736100. Prior to undertaking the meta-analysis of all GWAS data sets, we searched for potential errors and biases in data from each case-control series. With the exception of the Liverpool Lung Project, quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots showed that there was minimal inflation of the test statistics, indicating that substantial cryptic population substructure or differential genotype calling between cases and controls was unlikely in each of the GWASs (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). Imputation To refine the association of the previously reported and newly identified disease loci, we imputed untyped genotypes using Impute2, Mach1 or minimac software and HapMap Phase II, Phase III and/or 1000 Genome Project data release 2010-08 or 2010-06 reference genotypes (Supplementary Material, Table S6). The selected loci were 5p15.33 (1.20-1.61 Mb), 6p22.3-6p21.31 (22.0-36.5 Mb), 15q25.1 (76.1-77.2 Mb), 18q2.3 (40.0-21.5 Mb), 12p13.33 (0.54-1.54 Mb), 2q32.1 (183.4-184.5 Mb) and 9p21.3 (21.66-22.2 Mb) (NCBI Build 36). The analytical scheme was similar to the meta-analysis but taking imputation uncertainty into account by using posterior means or allele dosage in logistic regression. Imputed allele dosage for each SNP was tested for association with lung cancer risk using the two models with and without adjustment for smoking as described above. The meta-analysis of imputed genotypes included all studies except the HGF Germany where imputed data were not available. Poorly imputed SNPs defined by an RSQR < 0.30 with MACH1/minimac or an information measure Is < 0.30 with IMPUTE2 were excluded from the analyses (Supplementary Material, Table S6). Meta-analysis The meta-analysis was primarily based on pooling GWAS results for the log-additive model of inheritance from 318 094 SNPs featured on Illumina HumanHap 300 BeadChips arrays. For studies genotyped on HumanHap550 or 610Quad Illumina platforms, additional 217 914 SNPs were available to inform our analysis. Meta-analysis under fixed and random-effects models was conducted. As with individual studies, we examined for the over-dispersion of P-values in the meta-analysis by generating Q-Q plots and deriving an inflation factor lambda by comparison of observed versus expected P-values for the meta-analysis applying the estlambda function within the GenABEL package. Cochran's Q statistic to test for heterogeneity and the I2 statistic to quantify the proportion of the total variation due to heterogeneity were calculated. I2 values >=75% are considered the characteristic of large heterogeneity. To assess the robustness of associations in the meta-analysis, we performed a sensitivity analysis sequentially excluding studies. Wherever removing one study resulted in a >10% change of the OR point estimates, we reported results separately. All calculations were performed using PLINK and SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Q-Q and Manhattan plots were created using an R library GenABEL. We used LocusZoom for regional visualization of results. Power calculations were performed using QUANTO version 1.2.4 for the main effect of gene and the log-additive model of inheritance stipulating a P-value of 5.0 x 10-8.

29112194	TITLE	Genomewide association study identifies a novel locus for cannabis dependence
29112194	ABSTRACT	Despite moderate heritability, only one study has identified genomewide significant loci for cannabis-related phenotypes. We conducted meta-analyses of genomewide association study (GWAS) data on 2,080 DSM-IV cannabis dependent cases and 6,435 cannabis exposed controls of European descent. A cluster of correlated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a novel region on chromosome 10 was genomewide significant (lowest p = 1.3E-8). Among the SNPs, rs1409568 showed enrichment for H3K4me1 and H3K427ac marks, suggesting its role as an enhancer in addiction-relevant brain regions, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the angular and cingulate gyri. This SNP is also predicted to modify binding scores for several transcription factors. We found modest evidence for replication for rs1409568 in an independent cohort of African-American (896 cases and 1591 controls; p=0.03) but not European-American (781 cases and 1905 controls) participants. The combined meta-analysis (3,757 cases and 9,931 controls) indicated trend-level significance for rs1409568 (p=2.85E-7). No genomewide significant loci emerged for cannabis dependence criterion count (n=8,050). There was also evidence that the minor allele of rs1409568 was associated with a 2.1% increase in right hippocampal volume in an independent sample of 430 European-American college students (fwe-p=.007). The identification and characterization of genomewide significant loci for cannabis dependence is amongst the first steps towards understanding the biological contributions to the etiology of this psychiatric disorder, which appears to be rising in some developed nations.
29112194	INTRO	INTRODUCTION Cannabis is amongst the most commonly used illicit psychoactive substances in developed nations . Ten percent of individuals who ever use cannabis meet criteria for lifetime cannabis dependence, which is associated with significant comorbid adverse mental health outcomes. A recent survey of U.S. adults showed that the past year prevalence of cannabis use disorders has increased from 1.5% to 2.9% in the decade spanning 2002-2012, an increase apparently attributable to a corresponding increase in use during that period of time. About 50-60% of the variance in cannabis use disorders, including DSM-IV dependence, is attributable to the additive effects of genes (i.e., narrow sense heritability). Despite this, only one study to date has successfully identified genomewide significant loci for any cannabis related trait. Table 1 provides an overview of six genomewide association studies (GWASs) of cannabis-related phenotypes, the largest being a recent meta-analysis of GWASs of ever using cannabis, even once during the lifetime (N > 32,000). However, only the recent study by Sherva and colleagues identified genomewide significant loci (three independent regions) for DSM-IV cannabis dependence criterion counts in a sample of European-American (EA) and African-American (AA) descent. We conducted a meta-analysis of GWAS data on individuals of European descent from five cohorts to identify loci associated with DSM-IV cannabis dependence (N=2,080). We compared individuals who met criteria for DSM-IV cannabis dependence (N=2,080) to controls who did not meet criteria for cannabis dependence but reported having used cannabis, at least once, during their lives (N=6,435). In addition to comprehensive locus (including epigenetic) annotation, we examined whether genomewide significant SNPs were associated with variability in gray matter volume within brain regions (bilateral amygdala, ventral striatum and hippocampus) previously associated with chronic cannabis use and misuse  among an independent cohort of 430 EA college students. Some prior studies have reported lower gray matter volume in these brain regions, although results are inconclusive. While a majority of studies have attributed such volumetric changes to the effects of chronic cannabis exposure (e.g.,), at least one study has implicated common predisposing influences, such as genetic liability, as the major contributor to the association between casual cannabis use and variability in amygdala volume. As this sample of college students included <10 individuals who met criteria for cannabis dependence, we were principally interested in examining whether the top loci that emerged from the GWAS were associated with volumetric differences, whether regional brain volume varied across cannabis users and nonusers and further, whether the effects of top loci on cannabis involvement could be partly attributed to variability in brain volume.
29112194	METHODS	"MATERIALS AND METHODS Samples Data were drawn from 5 cohorts: (a) a case-control and (b) family GWAS  component of the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA; COGA-cc and COGA-f), (c) the Study of Addictions: Genes and Environment (SAGE), (d) the Australian Alcohol, Nicotine Addiction Genetics, and Childhood Trauma studies (OZALC+) and (e) the Comorbidity and Trauma Study (CATS). Individual studies have been described in detail in related publications and in Supplemental Text. An outline of the samples used in this study is available in Table 2. As the overwhelming majority of the data were on individuals of European-Australian and European-American descent, discovery analyses were restricted to individuals of European descent. All subjects provided informed consent and protocols were approved by the institutional review boards overseeing the individual studies (see Supplemental text). Summary statistics from European ancestry subjects in CATS, COGA-ccGWAS, COGA-fGWAS, OZALC+ and SAGE were combined to form the discovery analysis. Replication analyses were conducted in the Yale-Penn sample which was the major dataset contributing to the prior study by Sherva et al. Yale-Penn includes a large number of AA participants; thus, results from both EA and AA subjects were separately examined. Sherva et al also included SAGE data in their discovery cohort and used CATS as a replication sample. In our analyses, only the Yale-Penn component of Sherva et al was used for replication, while SAGE and CATS were part of the discovery cohort. Genotyping A variety of Illumina platforms were used to genotype the cohorts (Table S1). Quality control and imputation metrics for the individual samples are provided in referenced publications  and in Table S1. Phenotype Cases met criteria for DSM-IV cannabis dependence, which included withdrawal (i.e., 3 or more of 7 criteria) in COGA and SAGE but not in CATS or OZALC+. Controls did not meet criteria for cannabis dependence but reported a lifetime history of ever having used cannabis, even once. Follow-up analyses of top loci examined whether excluding those with DSM-IV cannabis abuse or 1-2 dependence criteria modified the results. A natural log-transformed (to account for skewed data) count of DSM-IV dependence criteria (0-6, excluding withdrawal; adding ""1"" for 0 values) was also analyzed (n=8,050). Finally, the effect of comorbid DSM-IV alcohol, nicotine and opioid dependence was investigated by examining their association with top loci in post hoc analyses. Statistical analysis Each sample was analyzed separately using specific analytic protocols that have been validated for that sample . Prior to meta-analysis, SNPs that did not satisfy quality control standards imposed for the current study were excluded (see Supplemental Text); only SNPs that survived quality control in all 5 samples were included in the meta-analysis. PLINK (v1.07) was used to analyze allele dosage data for SAGE, CATS and COGA-cc. GWAF-GEE was used to analyze the family data for DSM-IV cannabis dependence from COGA-f and OZALC+. Linear mixed models and Merlin-offline were used to analyze criterion counts in COGA-f and OZALC+ respectively. Logistic and linear regressions were used for the diagnosis and count definitions, respectively (see Table S1 for covariates used for each sample). Results were meta-analyzed in METAL using inverse variance weighting procedures and genomic control correction. Gene-based association analyses were conducted using MAGMA with the 1000 Genomes European data (release version 3, May 22, 2014) as the reference panel. Gene boundaries were extended to include a 10kb window at the 3' and 5' ends. Annotation Top SNPs (p<5E-8) were annotated using a variety of resources that are described in Supplemental Text. Replication Replication analyses were conducted in the Yale-Penn study (described in Supplemental Text, related publications  and Table S1). Cases met criteria for DSM-IV cannabis dependence (NEA=781, NAA=896) and controls (NEA=1,591, NAA=1,905) reported a lifetime history of cannabis use. Neuroimaging extension Data on 430 EA college students aged 18-22 years were drawn from the Duke Neurogenetics Study (DNS; Supplemental Text). First, we examined the association between genotype (rs1409568, modeled as C-allele carriers vs. T allele homozygotes) and (a) cannabis use (ever used and frequency of use in ever users) and (b) regional brain volume. A Generalized Linear Model in SPM8 was used to test whether genotype predicted regional volume within 6 brain regions (i.e., left and right amygdala, hippocampus, striatum) previously associated with cannabis use and misuse . Familywise error correction (FWE p < .05) with a 10-voxel extent cluster threshold was applied to each of these 6 anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) derived from the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas within Wake Forest University Pick Atlas software. Additional methodological details are presented in Supplemental Text. Second, we tested whether cannabis use (ever used; frequency of use in ever users) was associated with regional gray matter volume in any of these regions. Third, we examined whether associations between genotype and regional brain volume persisted after controlling for cannabis use. All DNS analyses controlled for sex and age; analyses on regional brain volume also controlled for total intracranial volume (ICV), while analyses including genotype additionally included the first three principal components of ancestry. All non-imaging analyses and group comparisons were conducted using the R (3.1.2) 'Stats' package."
29112194	RESULTS	RESULTS Sample characteristics Samples were relatively similar in age and gender distribution. By ascertainment design, there was considerable overrepresentation of all forms of substance use disorder across the samples (Table 2), with the exception of OZALC+ which included families that were ascertained based on family size rather than substance-related problems. GWAS results DSM-IV cannabis dependence Lambdas for individual studies and meta-analyses were close to 1.0 (Supplemental Table S1; Figure S1A). Genomewide significant loci did not emerge in any individual study. Meta-analysis of summary statistics from the 5 discovery samples (CATS, COGA-cc, SAGE, COGA-f, OZALC) revealed a cluster of genomewide significant SNPs in a region on chromosome 10 (Table 3 for loci at p-value < 10-6; Supplemental S2A for Manhattan plot; full results available upon request), with genomewide significant loci representing a single signal (Figure 1A for regional association plot). The lowest p-value was associated with rs77300175 (p-value = 1.3E-8; Table 3), with stronger contributions from the 3 case-control cohorts (SAGE, CATS, COGA-cc; Supplemental Table S2) than the family-based cohorts (COGA-f and OZALC+). Cannabis dependence criterion count There was no evidence for genomewide significant loci associated with cannabis dependence symptom counts (Supplemental Table S3; Supplemental Figures S1B and S2B). The most promising association was noted for a cluster of SNPs in chromosome 2 (e.g. rs2287641, p=9E-7). The chromosome 10 SNPs were similarly associated, but not at genomewide significant levels (e.g. rs150525973 P = 1.2E-6). Replication For the DSM-IV dependence diagnosis, findings were not replicated in Yale-Penn EA participants (Supplemental Table S4); effect sizes were consistently in the same direction, but smaller (e.g. rs1409568: beta = -0.072, p=0.6). Consistent with our finding, the T allele of rs1409568 was associated with a reduced likelihood of cannabis dependence among the AA participants from Yale-Penn (beta = -0.18, p = 0.028). When results from all datasets, discovery and replication (EA and AA), were meta-analyzed together (Ncase=3,757, Ncontrol=9,931), rs1409568 remained associated with DSM-IV cannabis dependence at a trend level (beta = -0.28; p = 2.9E-7). In addition, there was no evidence from our meta-analysis for association between cannabis dependence diagnosis or symptom counts with previously identified loci for cannabis use (i.e., top 10 signals from Stringer et al) and top EA locus from Sherva et al - Supplemental Table S5). Gene-based association There was no evidence for enrichment of association within genes for cannabis dependence diagnosis. (Supplemental Table S6); However, for symptom count, MEI1, on chromosome22, was associated at a gene-level (p=2.55E-6; Supplemental Table S7). Several other genes with SNPs of nominal significance clustered in this chromosomal region (Figure S3 for chromosome 22 regional association plot). Genomic and Epigenomic Annotation Genomewide significant SNPs on chromosome 10 were not in linkage disequilibrium (r2 >= 0.6) with non-synonymous variants in neighboring genes. No significant cis-eQTLs were identified for any chromosome 10 variant in any tissue in GTEx as well as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) tissue from the Common Mind Consortium data. However, there was preliminary evidence that rs1409568 (RegulomeDB score 3a), but not other variants in the region (scores >= 5) may have regulatory effects. Closer inspection in the Epigenome Browser showed that rs1409568 was accompanied by enhancer-enriched active histone modifications (H3K4me1 and H3K27ac) in a variety of brain tissues (Figure 2). Evidence of an active enhancer was particularly prominent in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), angular gyrus, cingulate gyrus and the inferior temporal lobe. There were also enriched H3K4me1 and H3K27ac signals in the middle hippocampus and the substantia nigra, however these signals were not detected at corrected thresholds defined by MACS (q-value cutoff 0.05). All of these regions are strongly implicated in the etiology of addiction. We determined that rs1409568 was within a chromosome 10 regulatory domain spanning 120,300,000bp - 120,790,000bp that encompassed all of the genome-wide significant SNPs. The regulatory domain included 12 genes, including 3 protein coding genes (PRLHR, CACUL1, NANOS1), 4 pseudogenes (SLC25A18P1, TOMM22P5, RP11-215A21.2, LDHAP5), and 5 non-coding genes (AL356865.1, AL356865.2, U3, RP11-498J9.2, AL15778.1). Seven of 12 genes were expressed in several brain-derived tissues (Supplementary Figure S4). RP11-215A21.1 is the gene closest to rs1409568 (1.3kb from the transcription start site), however, there is no evidence that rs1409568 regulates the expression of any gene within the regulatory domain. The T allele of rs1409568 is conserved within primates, but not between primates and rodents (Supplementary Figure S5). There was also evidence that rs1409568 altered the binding motif for several transcription factors that are critical during embryogenesis, including those encoded by genes that include homeodomains (e.g., HOXD8, VAX1) and those from the Pit-Oct-Unc (POU) family (e.g., POU4F1, POU4F3, POU6F2: for full list, see Supplemental Table S8). Although predictions were based on common tissue sources, several transcription factors showed brain-related expression (e.g., POU6F2). We identified 26 CpG probes that corresponded to genes with transcription start sites (TSS) within 1 Mb of rs1409568. Differences in CpG methylation were examined in CT (n=34) and TT (n=313) individuals in tissue from the frontal cortex and cerebellum. Only one probe (cg23182539), corresponding to TIA-1 related protein isoform 1 (TIAL1) showed nominal support for change in methylation scores as a function of genotype (Supplemental Table S9), with lower methylation scores in C allele carriers (beta = -0.56, p = 0.0017; Wilcoxon p = 0.005). However, methylation change in this gene was not significant after Bonferroni correction (26 probes x 2 regions; pcorrected = 0.00096). Sensitivity to definition of controls The chromosome 10 SNPs represented a single signal (Supplemental Figure S6), so follow-up analyses used a representative locus. Controls (N=6,435) included individuals who did not meet criteria for DSM-IV cannabis dependence but may have met criteria for a lifetime history of DSM-IV cannabis abuse or endorsed 1-2 dependence criteria. Exclusion of individuals with abuse (N=1,590) from among the controls yielded similar effect sizes but diminished statistical significance, likely due to the reduced statistical power (rs7098706: b = -0.53, p = 5.90E-7; rs1409568: b = -0.50, p = 1.21E-6). Excluding control individuals with abuse or 1-2 dependence criteria (N=2,152) had a similar effect (e.g., rs7098706 b = -.50, p = 1.85 E-6; rs1409568: b = -0.48, p = 3.95E-6). Thus, heterogeneity within the control population is not responsible for the observed association. Comorbidity with other substance use disorders Only nicotine dependence was associated with rs1409568, and in CATS alone (p = .003) - adding nicotine dependence as a covariate to the CATS analysis did not greatly alter the significance of rs1409568 (p = 5.51E-8; Supplemental Table S10). Alcohol dependence was not associated with rs1409568 in any individual study, although the meta-analytic p-value was less than 0.05. Genotype and brain volumetric variation In the DNS, 51% of the sample reported lifetime cannabis use, with 12% (n=52), 15% (n=66), 8.8% (n=38) and 15% (n=65) using cannabis 1-2, 3-10, 11-20 and >21 times during their lifetime respectively. Ever using cannabis and the frequency of use within lifetime users were not associated with rs1409568 genotype (C-allele carrier vs TT; only 2 individuals with CC genotype). However, the C allele, which was associated with increased likelihood of cannabis dependence in the meta-analysis, was associated with increased gray matter volume in the right hippocampus (2.13% greater than TT individuals; Cohen's d = 0.62, maximal voxel p-fwe = 0.007; Bonferroni p-value for 6 a priori regions = .008; Supplemental Figure S7A). This association remained unchanged when cannabis use was included as a covariate in the analysis (Cohen's d = 0.62, maximal voxel p-fwe = 0.008). Other regions previously associated with cannabis use (i.e., left hippocampus and bilateral amygdala and ventral striatum) showed no relationship with the SNP. Finally, ever having used cannabis was associated with increased volume in a cluster in the left hippocampus (3.18% greater in ever versus never users; Cohen's d = 0.39, maximal voxel p-fwe = 0.002; Supplemental Figure S7B). No significant volumetric differences were observed for the right hippocampus, where the SNP exerted main effects, nor was the cluster in the left hippocampus in the same region as the cluster in the right hippocampus to which rs1409568 was associated. Lastly, rs1409568 was not associated with hippocampal volume in an independent large meta-analysis (p=0.33; N=12, 516).
29112194	DISCUSS	DISCUSSION This study identified a genomewide significant locus on chromosome 10 for cannabis dependence diagnosis in subjects of European descent. To date, only one other (Table 1) study identified genomewide significant loci for cannabis dependence criterion count. The novel locus identified in the present study included a representative SNP, rs1409568, which showed modest evidence for replication in the AA, but not EA, participants from the independent Yale-Penn sample that was part of the only other study with genomewide significant SNPs. The lack of replication in the EA component of Yale-Penn may reflect lower power (i.e., fewer cases than the AA component, or higher minor allele frequency in AA than EA) or ascertainment differences. It is also noteworthy that patterns of LD for the SNPs in Table 3 differ across CEU and ASW populations (based on 1000 Genomes data; Supplemental Figure S8); replication that was noted in the AAs was present in spite of these differences. Nonetheless, associations in the Yale-Penn EA participants were in the same direction as the current meta-analysis. The genomewide significant chromosome 10 SNPs represent a single LD signal, and are located in a region that is primarily intergenic. However, based on GENCODEv19 annotation, there are multiple genes within the regulatory domain spanning these SNPs. While 5 of these 12 genes are expressed in brain-derived tissues (Supplemental Figure S4), none of the genomewide significant SNPs served as eQTLs for expression of these genes in GTEx, which includes modestly sized samples for a variety of brain tissue, nor in the larger Common Mind Consortium data, which includes 279 dlPFC samples. We found no evidence in the literature for the role of the genes within the regulatory domain in the etiology of addiction-related or other behavioral phenotypes. One genomewide significant SNP, rs1409568, appears to be located within an active enhancer. This finding is consistent with a recent study that reported modest enrichment of H3K27ac marks for a variety of complex traits (e.g., Crohn's disease). Importantly, there is growing evidence that intergenic genomewide significant loci are disproportionately overrepresented in regulatory regions, such as enhancers. For example, functional partitioning of SNP-attributable heritability for 11 complex traits found that DNase1 hypersensitivity sites were 1.6- and 5.1-fold enriched in genotyped and imputed data respectively, with enhancers being the most common subcategory, representing 31.7% of total SNP heritability and 9.8-fold enrichment. Importantly, rs1409568 is predicted to bear active enhancer marks in several brain-derived tissues that are critical to addiction, most notably the dlPFC and the cingulate and angular gyri, which play a major role in the development of addictive behaviors, particularly in the regulation of executive control and attentional bias. These in-silico findings imply that the C allele is associated with reduced or no binding of several homeodomain-containing developmentally relevant transcription factors, with some difference scores (e.g., POU6F2) being substantial (>8.0). These genes and their products have been variously implicated in embryogenesis and in cell-type specific pathways of differentiation, particularly in visual systems, but have not been related to behavioral traits thus far. There was also nominal evidence that rs1409568 genotype was associated with changes in CpG methylation of TIAL1. C allele carriers, on average, had lower methylation scores than T homozygotes. There is no published evidence for a role of the RNA-binding protein encoded by this gene in addictive processes. In an independent sample, the C allele of rs1409568 was also associated with a modest increase in right hippocampal volume (2.13%) but not with cannabis use itself. The hippocampus has been implicated in addiction, including volumetric differences that have been observed in chronic cannabis users . This, in addition to tentative evidence for the role of rs1409568 as a potential enhancer in the middle hippocampus (Figure 2), indicates that this SNP may regulate neural effects that are central to the development of addictions. The lack of association between cannabis use and genotype is not surprising given the vanishingly low number of problem users (e.g., 12 individuals with cannabis abuse) in the DNS sample. Cannabis use itself was associated with a modest increase (3.18%) in left (but not right) hippocampal volume. This finding contradicts prior studies that have linked chronic, but not occasional, cannabis use to decreases (not increases) in hippocampal volume. We speculate that the association between cannabis use and increased hippocampal volume may be due to the nature of DNS, which includes casual, non-problem users who are also likely enriched for other factors that might protect against progression to problem use (and against hippocampal deficits). In support of this, we found that cannabis users in DNS were more likely to represent higher socioeconomic status (t=3.70, p<0.001) and even showed modest increases in digit-span performance (t=2.50, p =.013), an index of working memory suggesting that cannabis users in DNS may be characterized by adaptive factors that protect them from progression to problem use. Therefore, if previously documented associations between cannabis use and smaller hippocampal volumes are a consequence of chronic exposure to cannabis, then we would not expect to see these reductions in the DNS. The minor allele of rs1409568, which was more common in cannabis dependent cases in the meta-analysis, was associated with increased hippocampal volume. This finding is also inconsistent with the hypothesis that liability to heavy cannabis use should relate to decreased hippocampal volume. There are, at least, two plausible explanations for our observation of the opposite association. First, it is possible that the association between rs1409568 and hippocampal volume is independent of its association with cannabis dependence in the meta-analysis. While such a pleiotropic effect adds encouraging evidence favoring a role of rs1409568 in neural regions typically associated with addiction, and augments its functional plausibility, it does not help reconcile the mechanism by which rs1409568 might influence liability to cannabis dependence. Second, the association between rs1409568 and hippocampal volume did not replicate in the large ENIGMA meta-analysis. This raises the possibility that the association is a false positive in DNS and suggests that caution is warranted in its interpretation. It is also noteworthy that the current study did not replicate previously noted associations for cannabis use or dependence. These are not unexpected. For cannabis use, our sample excluded individuals who had never used cannabis, thus limiting our ability to detect loci associated with initiation of cannabis involvement. Our lack of replication of one prior locus identified for cannabis dependence in EAs (rs77378271) might further underscore differences between our European samples and those comprising Yale-Penn. A full meta-analysis of these datasets might yield additional novel loci. While no single SNP was genomewide significant for the count of DSM criteria, gene-level testing identified MEI1 (meiotic double-stranded break formation protein 1). Relative to other tissues, MEI1 is more robustly expressed in the testes and variants in the gene have been associated with azoospermia due to early and complete meiotic arrest. In parallel, there is compelling epidemiological and biological support for the relationship between prolonged/heavy cannabis use and male reproductive health, including fertility. Weekly cannabis use has been associated with a 28-29% reduction in sperm concentration and count. The endocannabinoid system actively participates in the regulation of male fertility, including by promoting meiosis via CB2 activation. Therefore, the possibility of shared genetic pathways to male fertility and heavy cannabis use might provide a plausible alternative to more causal explanations. However, we are not aware of any prior studies that link MEI1 to cannabis use or addiction. Some limitations are noteworthy. First, despite aggregating across several large datasets, our meta-analytic sample was relatively underpowered to detect small effects and also, for analyses that would allow us to estimate genetic correlations between cannabis dependence and other traits (e.g. cigarettes per day for which genomewide summary statistics are available. Such calculations typically rely on unrelated cases and controls and our study included two samples with complex pedigree structures. Second, we did not have adequate numbers of AA participants for a full examination of loci identified in Sherva et al. In EAs, the only SNP associated at genomewide significant levels in Sherva et al was rs77378271 (CSMD1). In the current study, rs77378271 shows some evidence for independent association with cannabis dependence in COGA-cc (p=5.3E-3); however, the meta-analytic p-value was not significant, with indication of heterogeneity across the samples included in the present meta-analysis. We anticipate that additional data on cannabis dependence in both EA and AA participants will be available in the future. Finally, the minor allele frequency for rs1409568 (and related genomewide significant SNPs) was <10% across cases and controls from each sample. We identified a new genomewide significant locus on chromosome 10 that was associated with vulnerability to cannabis dependence in European ancestry individuals. One of the representative SNPs, rs1409568, showed promising epigenetic evidence and might also contribute to variation in hippocampal volume, which has been related to risk for and resilience to psychiatric disorders, including addictions. Replication, however, was limited to a subset of AA, but not EA, individuals and analyses in the DNS contradicted prior findings for hippocampal volume and did not extend to a broader meta-analysis of hippocampal volume. Therefore, the identification of this chromosome 10 locus should be viewed as preliminary. Future work that aggregates additional cannabis dependent cases and controls, would allow for the detection of smaller effect sizes and a more thorough investigation of comparability of loci across population groups. This is critical, as genomic research into cannabis involvement has lagged behind that of other drugs, despite the pressing public health significance of the problem. Continuing to identify risk factors, both genetic and environmental, that are associated with cannabis dependence is a public health priority, as understanding the genetic etiology of cannabis use disorders can ultimately help to identify individuals who are at greatest risk of the disorders and enhance efforts aimed at prevention and personalizing pharmacotherapy among affected individuals.

26621817	TITLE	Meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identifies common susceptibility polymorphisms for colorectal and endometrial cancer near SH2B3 and TSHZ1
26621817	ABSTRACT	High-risk mutations in several genes predispose to both colorectal cancer (CRC) and endometrial cancer (EC). We therefore hypothesised that some lower-risk genetic variants might also predispose to both CRC and EC. Using CRC and EC genome-wide association series, totalling 13,265 cancer cases and 40,245 controls, we found that the protective allele [G] at one previously-identified CRC polymorphism, rs2736100 near TERT, was associated with EC risk (odds ratio (OR) = 1.08, P = 0.000167); this polymorphism influences the risk of several other cancers. A further CRC polymorphism near TERC also showed evidence of association with EC (OR = 0.92; P = 0.03). Overall, however, there was no good evidence that the set of CRC polymorphisms was associated with EC risk, and neither of two previously-reported EC polymorphisms was associated with CRC risk. A combined analysis revealed one genome-wide significant polymorphism, rs3184504, on chromosome 12q24 (OR = 1.10, P = 7.23 x 10-9) with shared effects on CRC and EC risk. This polymorphism, a missense variant in the gene SH2B3, is also associated with haematological and autoimmune disorders, suggesting that it influences cancer risk through the immune response. Another polymorphism, rs12970291 near gene TSHZ1, was associated with both CRC and EC (OR = 1.26, P = 4.82 x 10-8), with the alleles showing opposite effects on the risks of the two cancers.
26621817	INTRO	Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the fourth commonest cancer in the western world and cancer of the uterine corpus, or endometrial carcinoma (EC), is the fourth commonest cancer among women. Both cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. There is evidence from rare, Mendelian cancer predisposition syndromes that CRC and EC can have a common aetiology. Specifically, germline mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2, and in DNA polymerases POLD1 and POLE predispose to a high incidence (lifetime risk 30-71%) of both CRC and EC. The MMR system maintains genomic stability by correcting mismatched nucleotide pairs that arise during DNA replication and MMR mutations cause a microsatellite instability (MSI+) phenotype in CRCs and ECs. Bi-allelic MLH1 promoter methylation and a few somatic mutations in MLH1 and MSH2 are seen in sporadic CRCs and ECs, causing the same MSI+ and hypermutator phenotype. Histologically, MMR-deficient CRCs and ECs are characterised by poor differentiation and the presence of mucinous and signet-cell features and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes. POLE and POLD1 encode polymerases that synthesise respectively the leading and lagging strand of the DNA replication fork. The exonuclease (proofreading) domains of these polymerases increase replication fidelity by recognising and excising mispaired bases. Germline missense mutations in the exonuclease domains of POLD1 and POLE predispose to both CRC and EC, and somatic POLE mutations occur in sporadic CRCs and ECs. Polymerase exonuclease domain mutations (EDMs) do not cause MSI, but lead to an ultramutator phenotype, with over one million base substitutions in some cancers. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified tens of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with a modestly increased risk (typically 10-25%) of CRC. In addition, one EC SNP, near HNF1B, has been reported at stringent levels of statistical significance. To date, the lists of CRC and EC SNPs are non-overlapping. Since CRC and EC may share mechanisms of pathogenesis, as evidenced by the high-penetrance germline mutations and the somatic (epi)mutations discussed above, we hypothesised (i) that some CRC SNPs may predispose to EC, and vice versa, and (ii) that there exist unidentified SNPs that predispose to both CRC and EC. In this study, we tested these hypotheses using 16 different CRC and EC GWAS data sets, totalling 13,265 cancer cases and 40,245 cancer-free or population controls.
26621817	METHODS	Methods GWAS data sets Five CRC GWAS data sets genotyped on various Illumina tag-SNP arrays were available, comprising: (i) CORGI (UK1), (ii) Scotland 1, (iii) VICTOR/QUASAR2/BC58, (iv) CFR1 and (v) CFR2/CGEMS (total 5,725 cases and 6,671 controls). The VQ58, CORGI and Scotland 1 series were genotyped using Illumina Hap300, Hap240S, Hap370, Hap550 or Omni2.5M arrays. BC58 genotyping was performed as part of the WTCCC2 study on Hap1.2M-Duo Custom arrays. The CCFR samples were genotyped using Illumina Hap1M, Hap1M-Duo or Omni-express arrays. CGEMS samples (all controls) were genotyped using Illumina Hap300 and Hap240 or Hap550 arrays. Standard quality -control measures were applied as reported. Moreover, any duplicate or cryptically related samples were excluded by pairwise identity by descent (IBD) analysis. EC GWAS comprised: (i) NSECG, (ii) ANECS and (iii) SEARCH (total 2,212 cases and 6,725 controls). All samples were of European ancestry with the majority of samples from the UK, and others from USA and Australia. Standard quality control measures were performed for each GWAS, as described in the referenced publications, and details about each dataset are shown in Table 1. Some of the control datasets, including the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2), have previously been used in both CRC and EC GWAS. We ensured that such controls were assigned proportionately to case data sets and were not used more than once (Table 1). Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted for all samples together, to ensure that all individuals were of European ancestry and we excluded all individuals who clustered outside the main centroid in pairwise plots of the first 4 PCs. The adequacy of case-control matching and possibility of differential genotyping of cases and controls was assessed using Q-Q plots of test statistics. lambdaGC values for the CORGI, Scotland1, VQ58, CCFR1 and CCFR2 studies were 1.02, 1.01, 1.01, 1.02 and 1.03 respectively, and those for NSECG, ANECS and SEARCH were 1.02, 1.02 and 1.00 respectively. EC targeted genotyping data sets A further 4,330 EC cases and 26,849 female controls were genotyped as part of the Endometrial Cancer Association Consortium (ECAC), with samples from seven countries: UK, USA, Belgium, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Australia. The controls were selected from healthy females participating in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) and Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC) part of the iCOGS project and matched and analysed with cases in eight groups by geographical location (see Table 1). These samples were genotyped using a custom Illumina Infinium iSelect array with 211,155 SNPs designed by the COGS (Collaborative Oncological Gene-environment Study) initiative. The SNPs on this array were chosen based on regions of interest from previous breast, prostate, ovarian and endometrial cancer studies, rather than on genome-wide coverage. We did not impute genotypes from the COGS studies, but included directly-genotyped SNPs in the discovery meta-analysis. These SNPs were not used for locus fine mapping. Association study and meta-analysis Whole-genome imputation using two reference panels (1000 Genomes 2012 release and 196 high-coverage whole genome-sequenced UK individuals) was performed with IMPUTE2, yielding up to 6 million SNPs either typed or imputed with high quality (info score >0.9). Case-control analysis for each GWAS data set was performed using frequentist tests with a logistic regression model using SNPTEST (v2.4). There was no evidence of systematic over-dispersion of the test statistic for any of the 16 studies (lambdaGC = 1.01-1.04 based on weakly correlated SNPs, r2 < 0.2). Fixed-effects, inverse variance weighted meta-analysis was conducted for the 6 million well-imputed SNPs in the eight CRC and EC GWAS (8,935 cases, 13,396 controls) across the genome using GWAMA (v2.1). For the ~200,00 SNPs genotyped on the COGS array, the additional 4,330 EC cases and 26,849 controls from ECAC were included in a meta-analysis of 16 studies yielding a total of 13,265 cases and 40,245 controls for these loci. SNPs with globally significant CRC/EC associations (Pmeta < 5 x 10-8) were identified and the regions examined using standard fine mapping and annotation methods. Previously reported CRC and EC SNPs The effects of 25 previously published tag-SNPs that have been formally associated with CRC risk in GWAS were investigated in EC (Table 2). We additionally assessed two SNPs (near TERT and MTHFR) with convincing CRC associations from focussed studies. We estimated that our EC sample set provided 72% power to detect the effect of a typical CRC SNP (allele frequency = 0.25, per allele odds ratio = 1.1) at P = 0.05, and 23% power to detect a similar allele at P = 0.001, corresponding to a false discovery rate of q = 0.05 in our sample. Two EC SNPs from GWAS were similarly investigated in CRC. All of these SNPs were either discovered or replicated in European populations and were genotyped directly or had near-perfect proxies on the Illumina GWAS arrays used; 13 of the SNPs were also present on the iCOGS arrays. Three EC SNPs in the TERT-CLPTM1L region were not included in this analysis, owing to poor tagging on the GWAS arrays and hence sub-optimal imputation. Genome-wide enrichment of susceptibility SNPs between CRC and EC Beyond the 29 previously published associations, we investigated the presence of genome-wide enrichment for CRC and EC. After removing previous associations, we pruned the set of 6 million typed or well-imputed SNPs (r2 < 0.1) to 246,896. Using several P value thresholds, we determined whether there was a tendency for the same SNPs to co-occur in the lists of putative CRC and EC SNPs, irrespective of direction of effect.
26621817	RESULTS	Results We initially investigated the 29 previously-identified CRC and EC polymorphisms (Table 2). One SNP, rs2736100, originally reported in CRC, was significantly associated with EC risk (OR: 0.93, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.89-0.96, P = 0.000167) after correcting for multiple testing (P<0.001). The risk allele for CRC [A] was protective in EC. rs2736100 lies in the intronic region of the telomerase reverse transcriptase TERT. It or highly correlated SNPs have previously been associated with the risk of multiple different cancer types, and we ourselves have previously found evidence that these TERT SNPs are associated with EC risk. Two other CRC SNPs (rs6691170 and rs10936599) were nominally associated with EC risk (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the latter of these lies close to the telomerase RNA component TERC locus; it is a multi-cancer risk SNP and has been associated with longer telomeres. Overall, 15 of the 29 SNPs showed the same direction of effect in both cancer types (that is, same nominal risk allele, irrespective of effect size), and this evidently was not a significant deviation from randomness (P = 1, binomial sign test). Meta-analysis of all CRC and EC data sets revealed a single genome-wide significant SNP, rs3184504, on chromosome 12q24 (OR: 1.10, 95% CI 1.07-1.13, Pmeta: 7.23 x 10-9, heterogeneity I2 = 0; Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1). This SNP is a missense variant (p.Trp262Arg) in exon 4 of SH2B3. It has not previously been associated with either CRC or EC. The major [C] allele was consistently the risk allele in all datasets, including those analysed using the iCOGS array, on which the SNP was included due to promising, but unproven, associations below genome-wide significance in previous breast cancer and EC GWAS. An additional 3 SNPs (Fig. 2) in strong pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs3184504 (r2 > 0.9) showed strong evidence of CRC-EC association (Pfine mapping < 10-5). These 4 SNPs lie in a 68kb region, that includes the genes SH2B3 and ATXN2, and their functional annotation is shown in Supplementary Table 2. None of the 4 SNPs was associated with the mRNA level of SH2B3, ATXN2 or other nearby genes in public eQTL databases (details not shown). There are SNPs that have previously been independently identified in GWAS of different phenotypes where the risk allele for one phenotype is the protective allele for another. In order to search for SNPs for which the same allele has differing directions of effect in CRC and EC, we conducted a fixed-effect meta-analysis with the odds ratios of all the CRC SNPs GWAS inverted (Supplementary Table 3). In this analysis, we discovered rs12970291 on chromosome 18q22, where the major G allele is protective in CRC (OR:0.78, 95%CI:0.69-0.90, 3.42 x 10-4) and confers risk in EC (OR:1.24, 95%CI: 1.11-1.38, p:1.11 x 10-4). In meta-analysis, the rs12970291 association reached genome-wide significance (OR:1.26, 95%CI:1.16-1.38, Pmeta:4.82 x 10-8; Fig. 3). Fine mapping analysis identified a large number of SNPs in high pairwise LD with rs12970291 (r2 > 0.85), in a 70 kb region that includes the gene TSHZ1, which is ~15 kb proximal to rs12970291 (Fig. 4). Seventeen SNPs had a stronger disease association than rs12970291 in fine mapping, with the lowest P value at rs35185115 (Pfine mapping = 1.08 x 10-6). Fine mapping of CRC and EC GWAS separately (Supplementary Figure 1) showed an association peak occurring in the same LD block between 10.5-51.8 kb downstream of TSHZ1, while an additional suggestive association signal near rs17263435 (PEC = 4.35 x 10-5) was not present in CRC (PCRC = 0.1). Several SNPs in the region have potential functional importance (Supplementary Table 4), and of particular note is the missense SNP rs3390274 (p.Ala468Thr) in the last exon of TSHZ1. SNPs with a pairwise LD of >0.4 with rs12970291 in the region were not significantly associated with mRNA level of TSHZ1 or other nearby genes in public eQTL databases (details not shown). Finally, we performed genome-wide enrichment analysis for nearly 250,000 independent SNPs (r2 < 0.1) below genome-wide significance levels to investigate whether there was a set of cryptic shared CRC and EC risk loci (Supplementary Table 5). Using P value thresholds of 10-3, 10-2 and 0.05, we found no evidence of a significant sharing of CRC and EC SNPs using this method.
26621817	DISCUSS	Discussion Using a combined CRC and EC GWAS meta-analysis, we have identified a region on chromosome 12q24.1 spanning two genes, SH2B3 and ATXN2, which contains a SNP that is formally associated at GWAS thresholds of significance with cancer risk. Of the variants in this region, rs3184504 is of particular interest, because it is a non-synonymous change (TGG   CGG; p.Trp262Arg) in the pleckstrin homology domain of SH2B3, which is a priori a much stronger candidate than the spinocerebellar ataxia gene ATXN2. SH2B3 is a member of the SH2B adaptor family of proteins and is involved in a range of signalling activities by growth factor and cytokine receptors. It is a key negative regulator in cytokine signalling in haematopoiesis, and is expressed at a high level in the bone marrow and white blood cells, but at a low level in the normal bowel and endometrium (EMBL-EBI expression atlas). Comparative genomics shows that the rs3184504 risk allele (C, Arg residue) is conserved in all primates and some vertebrates (Supplementary Figure 1), and has a much lower allele frequency (~0.5) in Europeans than in African, Asian and admixed American populations (~1.0). Amino acids Trp (tryptophan) and Arg (arginine) present in the two forms of the polymorphic SH2B3 protein possess a hydrophobic (uncharged) and positively charged side chain respectively. Different programs that predict the effect of this variation on protein function vary in their assessment (Grantham score = 121 (range 0-215), Polyphen2 = 0.12, SIFT = 1.0, CADD score PHRED-scaled = 5.532); overall, the possibility remains that the amino acid change has a modest or greater effect on protein function. The NHGRI GWAS Catalog shows that SNPs in the SH2B3/ATNX2 region including rs3184504 and rs653178 have been previously associated with immune-mediated conditions: coeliac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, autoimmune hepatitis and also cardiovascular traits including coronary artery disease and blood pressure. The genotype at rs653178 has been linked to levels of SH2B3 mRNA expression in peripheral blood cell eQTL analysis (p = 9.24 x 10-12), although this association is not present in public eQTL data sets. Interestingly, rs3184504 T is generally the risk allele in autoimmune traits, suggesting opposing effects of the functional polymorphism on cancer and other traits, perhaps via shared effects on immune activation. A similar phenomenon has been found for the HNF1B SNP rs4430796 which has opposing effects on EC and type 2 diabetes risk. The TERT-CLPTM1L locus has been identified in multiple cancer susceptibility GWAS and it is of interest that the CRC SNP rs2736100 also shows signs of significance in EC in our analysis (OR:1.08, 95%CI:1.04-1.12, P = 1.67 x 10-4). In parallel with this study and using overlapping data sets, we have recently performed a detailed analysis of the TERT-CLPTM1L locus in EC which provided evidence that rs7705526 is associated with EC risk (Passoc = 7.7 x 10-5), albeit at locus-specific rather than genome-wide significance thresholds. rs7705526 is moderately correlated with rs2736100 (r2 ~ 0.5) but is poorly tagged in most Illumina GWAS arrays. Supplementary Figure 2 shows the complex LD structure between these two SNPs and 4 other SNPs previously associated with CRC and EC at varying levels of significance (P = 8.4 x 10-3 to 4.9 x 10-6) at this locus. The rs2736100 A allele is the risk allele for CRC and testicular germ cell tumour, while the same allele is protective for EC, glioma and lung cancer, suggesting that this variant has its effects in a tissue-specific manner. Interestingly, we have found evidence in this study for a SNP (rs12970291, chromosome 18q22) that has opposing allelic effects on CRC and EC risk. The top candidate gene in this region is TSHZ1 which encodes zinc finger homeodomain factor teashirt zinc finger family member 1, a protein involved in skin, skeletal, brain and gut development that is functionally related to the CRC gene BMP4. One of several candidate SNPs near and within TSHZ1 is the uncommon missense variant rs33930274 (p.Ala468Thr) in the last exon of TSHZ1, although the predicted functional consequences of this change are inconsistent (Grantham score = 58, SIFT = 0.0, Polyphen2 = 0.0, CADD score PHRED-scaled: 0.001). Apart from the SH2B3 and TERT SNPs, only two of 27 previously-reported CRC SNPs, including one near TERC, showed any good evidence of association with EC and neither of the known EC SNPs was associated with CRC risk. Otherwise, there was no convincing evidence for a shared EC and CRC predisposition based on common polymorphisms, although it will be important to keep repeating multi-cancer GWAS as more risk SNPs are identified, and sub-set analyses - for example of MSI+ ECs and CRCs - might also be fruitful. It remains a little puzzling that, like breast and ovarian cancer, CRC and EC share high-penetrance risk alleles, yet relatively few common risk alleles of modest effect.

Black squares represent the point estimate of the odds ratio and have areas proportional to study size. Lines represent 95% confidence intervals. The diamond shows the summary statistic. The overall heterogeneity statistic is shown. There is also no evidence of heterogeneity between the pooled CRC and pooled EC studies (details not shown). Regional association plot for region around rs3184504. Plots are produced in LocusZoom and show the most strongly associated SNP, rs3184504 (purple diamond). rs7137828, intron of ATXN2, is the SNP with the second lowest P value. The primary aim of this analysis is to compare association signals among SNPs in the region. Therefore, the data are derived from a meta-analysis of genotyped or high-quality imputed SNPs in the GWAS data sets, and because imputation quality was more variable in iCOGS than in the GWAS data, the iCOGS samples are not included. Forest plot showing association between cancer risk and rs12970291 genotype in each data set. Legend is as for Fig. 1. Regional association plot for region around rs12970291. Legend is as for Fig. 2, except as follows. The most strongly associated SNP from the full discovery meta-analysis (rs12970291, purple diamond) is not the most strongly associated in the GWAS data sets. The most strongly associated SNP, rs35185115, lies about 30kb downstream of TSHZ1, but this SNP imputed poorly in iCOGS and was therefore assessed in fewer samples in the discovery meta-analysis than rs12970291, which was directly genotyped in iCOGS.

25990418	TITLE	A new GWAS and meta-analysis with 1000Genomes imputation identifies novel risk variants for colorectal cancer
25990418	ABSTRACT	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of colorectal cancer (CRC) have identified 23 susceptibility loci thus far. Analyses of previously conducted GWAS indicate additional risk loci are yet to be discovered. To identify novel CRC susceptibility loci, we conducted a new GWAS and performed a meta-analysis with five published GWAS (totalling 7,577 cases and 9,979 controls of European ancestry), imputing genotypes utilising the 1000 Genomes Project. The combined analysis identified new, significant associations with CRC at 1p36.2 marked by rs72647484 (minor allele frequency [MAF] = 0.09) near CDC42 and WNT4 (P = 1.21 x 10-8, odds ratio [OR] = 1.21 ) and at 16q24.1 marked by rs16941835 (MAF = 0.21, P = 5.06 x 10-8; OR = 1.15) within the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) RP11-58A18.1 and ~500 kb from the nearest coding gene FOXL1. Additionally we identified a promising association at 10p13 with rs10904849 intronic to CUBN (MAF = 0.32, P = 7.01 x 10-8; OR = 1.14). These findings provide further insights into the genetic and biological basis of inherited genetic susceptibility to CRC. Additionally, our analysis further demonstrates that imputation can be used to exploit GWAS data to identify novel disease-causing variants.
25990418	INTRO	Twin studies indicate that heritable factors account for 35% of the variation in risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). However, only 5% of CRC can be attributed to the inheritance of high-penetrance mutations in the known genes. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted primarily in European but also Asian populations have vindicated the long-held belief that part of the heritable risk of CRC is attributable to common, low-risk variants. These GWAS have provided insights into the biological basis of CRC, highlighting the role of genes within the bone morphogenetic protein signalling pathway (BMP2, BMP4, GREM1 and SMAD7) and some candidate genes (e.g. CDH1/CDH3), as well as genes not previously implicated in CRC (e.g. POLD3, TERC, CDKN1A and SHROOM2). Despite the success of GWAS the risk SNPs so far identified in European populations account for only 8% of the familial CRC risk (Supplementary Table 1). Together with the over-representation of association signals in GWAS strongly suggests that additional risk SNPs remain to be discovered. The statistical power of individual GWAS is limited by the modest effect sizes of the genetic variants and the requirement for a stringent threshold to establish statistical significance in order to avoid type 1 errors. Meta-analysis of GWAS data therefore offers the opportunity to identify new CRC risk loci and provide further insights into tumour biology. Furthermore, imputation of untyped variants in GWAS data using publicly available reference datasets increases the number of variants that can be tested for an association with CRC risk. To identify new CRC susceptibility loci, we conducted an independent primary scan of CRC using patient samples from the COIN trial and performed a genome-wide meta-analysis with five previously published GWAS. To recover untyped genotypes, thereby maximising the prospects of identifying risk variants, we imputed over 10 million SNPs in the six GWAS datasets, using data from the 1000 Genomes Project as reference (see Materials & Methods for details).
25990418	METHODS	Methods Primary GWAS The COIN GWAS was based on 2,244 CRC cases (64% male, mean age 61 years, SD = 10) ascertained through two independent Medical Research Council clinical trials of advanced/metastatic CRC; COIN and COIN-B. Cases were genotyped using Affymetrix Axiom Arrays according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA 95051, USA), using duplicate samples and sequencing of significantly associated SNPs in a subset of samples to confirm genotyping accuracy. For all SNPs >99% concordant results were obtained. For controls, we made use of Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2) Affymetrix 6.0 array data on 2,674 individuals from the UK Blood Service Control Group. Individuals were excluded with: <95% successfully genotyped SNPs (n = 122), discordant sex information (n = 8), classed as out of bounds by Affymetrix (n = 30), duplication or cryptic relatedness (identity by descent >0.185, n = 4), evidence of non-white European ancestry using PCA in conjunction with HapMap samples (n = 130; cut-off based on the minimum and maximum values of the top two principal components of the controls; Supplementary Figure 2). The details of all sample exclusions are provided in Supplementary Figure 3. We excluded SNPs from the analysis with: call rate <95%; different missing genotype rate between cases and controls at P < 10-5; MAF < 0.01; departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls at P < 10-5. The adequacy of the case-control matching and the possibility of differential genotyping of cases and controls were assessed using quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots of test statistics. Published GWAS Statistical and bioinformatic analysis Analyses were undertaken using R(v3.02) and PLINK software. The association between each SNP and the risk of CRC was assessed by the Cochran-Armitage trend test. ORs and associated 95% CIs were calculated by unconditional logistic regression. Phasing of GWAS SNP genotypes was performed using SHAPEIT(v2.644). Prediction of the untyped SNPs was carried out using IMPUTE(v2.3.0) based on the data from the 1000 Genomes Project (Phase 1 integrated variant set, v3.20101123) as reference. Imputed data were analyzed using SNPTEST(v2.4.1). Association meta-analyses only included markers with info scores >0.4, imputed call rates/SNP > 0.9 and MAFs > 0.01. The fidelity of imputation, as assessed by the concordance between imputed and sequenced SNPs, was examined in a subset of 200 UK cases. Meta-analyses were carried out using META(v2.4-1), under an inverse-weighted fixed-effects model using the genotype probabilities from IMPUTE, where a SNP was not directly typed. We calculated Cochran's Q statistic to test for heterogeneity and the I2 statistic to quantify the proportion of the total variation that was caused by heterogeneity -I2 values >=75% are considered characteristic of large heterogeneity. Associations by sex, age and clinico-pathological phenotypes were examined by logistic regression in case-only analyses. The familial relative risk of CRC attributable to each variant was calculated as detailed by Pharoah et al. assuming the overall familial risk of CRC, as shown in epidemiological studies, is 2.2. To explore epigenetic profiles of association signals, we used ChromHMM. States were inferred from ENCODE Histone Modification data on the CRC cell line HCT116 (DNAse, H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K27ac, Pol2 and CTCF) binarized using a multivariate Hidden Markov Model. To examine whether any of the SNPs or their proxies (i.e. r2 > 0.8 in 1000genomes CEU reference panel) annotate putative transcription factor binding/enhancer elements we used the CADD (combined annotation dependent depletion) web-server. We assessed sequence conservation using: PhastCons (<0.3 indicative of conservation), Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling (GERP) (-12 to 6, with 6 being indicative of complete conservation) and CADD (>10.0 deemed to be deleterious). Analysis of TCGA data To examine for a relationship between SNP genotype and mRNA expression we made use of Tumor Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA-seq expression and Affymetrix 6.0 SNP data (dbGaP accession number: phs000178.v7.p6) on 223 colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD) and 75 rectal adenocarcinoma samples using a best proxy where SNPs were not represented directly. Association between normalised RNA counts per-gene and SNP genotype was quantified using the Kruskal-Wallis trend test. The frequency of somatic mutations in CRC was obtained using the CBioPortal for Cancer Genomics and TumorPortal web servers. Pathway analysis To determine whether any genes mapping to the three newly identified regions act in pathways already over-represented in GWAS regions we utilized the NCI pathway interaction database. All genes within the LD block containing each tagSNP, or linked to the SNP through functional experiments (MYC) were submitted as a Batch query using the NCI-Nature curated data source. Assignment of microsatellite instability (MSI), KRAS, NRAS and BRAF status in cancers Tumour MSI status in CRCs was determined using the mononucleotide microsatellite loci BAT25 and BAT26, which are highly sensitive MSI markers. Samples showing more than or equal to five novel alleles, when compared with normal DNA, at either or both markers were assigned as MSI-H (corresponding to MSI-high). Tumours from the COIN study were screened for mutations in KRAS codons 12, 13, and 61 and BRAF codon 600 by pyrosequencing. Additionally, KRAS (all three codons), BRAF (codons 594 and 600), and NRAS (codons 12 and 61) were screened for mutations by MALDI-TOF mass array (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA).
25990418	RESULTS	Results In the primary scan, 2,244 advanced (stage IV) CRC cases ascertained through the Medical Research Council (MRC) trials COIN and COIN-B were analysed with control data on 2,674 individuals from the WTCCC2 UK National Blood Service Control Group. After applying strict quality control criteria (Materials and Methods), we analysed 234,675 autosomal SNPs for association with CRC risk in 1,950 cases and 2,162 controls. A Q-Q plot of observed versus expected chi2-test statistics showed little evidence for an inflation of test statistics, thereby excluding the possibility of substantive hidden population substructure, cryptic relatedness among subjects or differential genotype calling (inflation factor lambda = 1.05; Supplementary Figure 1). We performed a meta-analysis of our primary scan data with five non-overlapping GWAS case-control series of Northern European ancestry, which have been previously reported (Supplementary Table 2). The adequacy of the case-control matching and possibility of differential genotyping of cases and controls was assessed using Q-Q plots of test statistics. lambdaGC values for the UK1, Scotland1, VQ58, CCFR1 and CCFR2 studies were 1.02, 1.01, 1.01, 1.02 and 1.03 respectively (Supplementary Figure 1). Any ethnic outliers or individuals identified as related were excluded (Supplementary Figure 2). After quality control procedures, the six GWAS provided data on 7,577 CRC cases and 9,979 controls. To maximise the prospects of identifying novel risk variants, we imputed over 10 million variants using 1000 Genomes Project Pilot data as a reference panel. Q-Q plots for all variants post-imputation did not show evidence of substantive over-dispersion introduced by imputation (Supplementary Figure 1). Meta-analysis Associations for all 23 established European CRC risk SNPs showed a direction of effect consistent with previously reported studies, with eight of the loci having a P-value of <5.0 x 10-8 (Supplementary Table 3; Fig. 1). Additionally six SNPs previously identified in GWAS in Asian populations as determinants of CRC risk showed evidence for an association in this meta-analysis; albeit at varying degrees of significance (P-values ranging from 3.64 x 10-2 to 1.71 x 10-3; Supplementary Table 3); thereby providing support for trans-ethnic effects. Excluding SNPs (including those correlated with r2 > 0.8) mapping to the risk loci, five variants in distinct regions of linkage disequilibrium (LD) were associated with CRC at P < 1.0 x 10-7 (Table 1; Fig. 1). We assessed the fidelity of imputation in 200 UK cases by comparing imputed genotypes with those obtained by sequencing. For the three common variants (MAF > 0.05), rs72647484, rs16941835 and rs10904849 which each had imputation info scores >0.9 there was high correlation between imputed and directly typed genotype (r2 = 0.98, 1.00 and 0.99, respectively). For the rare variant rs79900961 (MAF = 0.016), the correlation was poor (r2 = 0.60). The call rate for the rare Indel on chromosome 5q15 (rs202110856) in the sequencing data was only 71% and both imputed heterozygotes were sequenced as homozygous reference. Therefore, only the three common variants at 1p36.12, 10p13 and 16q24.1 were subject to further analyses. In the combined analysis of the six GWAS datasets, rs72647484, which maps to chromosome 1p36.12 (22,587,728 bps; NCBI build 37), showed the strongest evidence for association with CRC (P = 1.21 x 10-8; Phet = 0.33, I2 = 14%; Fig. 2a). rs72647484 maps within a 300 kb block of LD encompassing WNT4 (wingless-type mmtv integration site family, member 4; MIM 603490) and CDC42 (cell division cycle 42, MIM 116952; Fig. 3a). The second strongest association was provided by rs16941835 (P = 5.06 x 10-8; Phet = 0.40, I2 = 3%; Fig. 2c) which localises to the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) RP11-58A18.1 at chromosome 16q24.1 (86,659,720 bps; NCBI build 37) within a 65 kb region of LD (Fig. 3c). The nearest coding gene, ~500 kb away, is the transcription factor FOXL1. The third strongest association was provided by rs10904849 (P = 7.01 x 10-8; Phet = 0.83, I2 = 0%; Fig. 2b) which localises to chromosome 10p13 (16,997,266 bps; NCBI build 37) within intron 31 of the gene encoding cubulin (CUBN; alias intrinsic factor-cobalamin receptor [IFCR], MIM 602997; Fig. 3b). Bioinformatic analysis of risk variants To gain insight into the biological basis of the associations we analysed publicly available RNA-seq expression and SNP data from TCGA on 223 colonic and 75 rectal cancers using rs10904850 and rs2744753 as proxies for rs10904849 (r2 = 0.97; D' = 1.00) and rs72647484 (r2 = 0.64; D' = 0.89) respectively. After adjustment for multiple testing, no significant associations were seen between SNP genotype and expression of genes mapping to any of the three risk loci (Supplementary Table 4). We examined whether any of the SNPs or their proxies (i.e. r2 > 0.8 in 1000 Genomes CEU reference panel) lie at putative transcription factor binding/enhancer elements and derived GERP and PhastCons scores to asses sequence conservation at these positions (Supplementary Table 5). rs16941835 maps to a regulatory feature with histone modification suggestive of an enhancer element. rs10904852, in LD with rs10904849 (r2 = 0.95, D' = 1.00) is conserved (GERP and PhastCons scores of 1.20 and 0.47 respectively) with CADD score of 11.53. A moderate CADD score (8.21) was associated with rs7267484 (22,590,125 bps) which is strong LD with rs72647489 (r2 = 0.93, D' = 1.00). Six proxy SNPs in LD with rs16941835 showed some evidence of transcription factor binding (Supplementary Table 5). We made use of TCGA data to examine the frequency of somatic mutation of CDC42, WNT4, FOXL1 or CUBN in CRC. None of these genes showed evidence of significant somatic mutation. Next, we conducted pathway analysis to determine whether any genes mapping to the three newly identified regions act in pathways already over-represented in GWAS. Pathways containing three or more genes are shown in Supplementary Table 6. While this analysis identifies the BMP-signalling pathway as expected, no catalogued pathways were discernible involving genes mapping to any of the newly identified regions. It is increasingly recognized that some genetic variants can have pleiotropic effects, influencing the risk of more than one cancer type. To explore the possibility that rs72647484, rs10904849 or rs16941835 affects the risk of other malignancies, we examined the association with lung cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, multiple myeloma, glioma and meningioma using data from previously reported GWASs. However, for these cancers, there was no evidence of rs72647484, rs10904849 or rs16941835 (or correlated SNP r2 >= 0.8) being associated with tumour risk (i.e. P > 0.05). Finally, the relationship between clinico-pathological variables (sex, age at diagnosis, family history of CRC, tumour stage or microsatellite instability (MSI), KRAS-mutant status and BRAF-mutant status) and genotype at rs72647484, rs10904849 and rs16941835 was assessed by case-only logistic regression (Supplementary Table 7). There was evidence of a relationship between rs72647484 and KRAS-mutant status (P = 0.03) with the T risk allele associated with KRAS-mutant CRC; however this finding was not significant after accounting for multiple testing. None of the other SNPs showed any association with any of the clinico-pathological variables examined (i.e. P > 0.05).
25990418	DISCUSS	"Discussion We have provided evidence supporting the existence of new susceptibility loci for CRC at 1p36.12, 10p13 and 16q24.1. The 1p36.12 association implicates WNT4 and/or CDC42 as possible determinates of CRC risk. WNT4 is part of a family of structurally related genes that encode cysteine-rich secreted glycoproteins that act as extracellular signalling factors. WNT4, WNT14, and WNT16 may play redundant roles in signalling through the CTNNB1-mediated canonical Wnt-pathway which is known to play a central role in colorectal tumorigenesis. Additionally, WNT4 signalling appears to play a pivotal role during organogenesis, acting as an autoinducer of mesenchyme-to-epithelial transition. Inactivating germline mutations in WNT4 cause mullerian aplasia and hyperandrogenism (MIM 158330) and are responsible for the autosomal recessive SERKAL syndrome (Sex Reversal and Kidney, Adrenal, and Lung dysgenesis; MIM 611812). A priori dysfunction of either WNT4 or CDC42 could be the biological basis for the 1p36.12 association. Cdc42 is a Ras-related GTP-binding protein with roles in establishment of cell polarity, regulation of cell morphology, motility, and cell cycle progression in mammalian cells, and malignant transformation. Notably, Cdc42 regulates the actin cytoskeleton through activation of WASP proteins and cell polarity through GSK3-beta and APC. Rho-GTPase signalling has a documented role in the development of CRC. Activation of Rho GTPase Cdc42 promotes adhesion and invasion in CRC and targeting Cdc42 with AZA197 suppresses primary colon cancer growth and prolongs survival in a xenograft model through down regulation of PAK1. Since rs10904849 is intronic to CUBN and the region of LD does not encompass any other genes or transcripts, there is a high likelihood that the functional basis of the 10p13 association is mediated through CUBN. Cubilin is the intestinal receptor for the endocytosis of intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 and a receptor in epithelial apoA-I/HDL metabolism. Additionally cubilin is an important co-receptor in the endocytic pathway for retrieval of 25(OH)D3-DBP complexes by megalin-mediated endocytosis in the kidney. Germline mutations in CUBN cause recessive megaloblastic anemia-1 (MGA1; MIM 261100). It is conceivable that common genetic variance in CUBN, while being insufficient to cause a ""MGA type phenotype"" would have physiological effects by virtue of long term effect on the cellular bioavailability of B12. Although it is entirely speculative, as epidemiological studies have yet to convincingly establish levels of B12 as a risk factor for CRC, its role in DNA biosynthesis makes genetically determined variation in B12 availability a plausible candidate for a role in the development of CRC. LncRNAs are regulators of transcription and are increasingly recognised as playing a role in cancer biology. While there is currently no evidence to implicate the RP11-58A18.1 lncRNA in CRC, lncRNAs CCAT1 and CCAT2 probably do play such roles, and it is entirely plausible that the impact of variation at 16q24.1 on risk is mediated through similar long range effects. One of the reasons for the failure to identify these CRC-loci previously is that, in addition to the issue of study power, they were not optimally tagged by SNPs featured on many commercial arrays. The power of our study to detect the major common loci conferring risks of 1.2 or greater (such as the 18q24 variant) was high. Hence, it is very unlikely there are additional CRC SNPs with similar effects for alleles with frequencies >0.2 in populations of European ancestry. In this study, we have only considered SNPs showing evidence of an association with a stipulated P-value threshold of <1 x 10-7. There exist, however, many variants with P-values just above this threshold which may also warrant investigation in a further study (Fig. 1). Hence further efforts to expand the scale of GWAS meta-analyses, in terms of both sample size and SNP coverage, and to increase the number of SNPs taken forward to large-scale replication, may identify additional variants for CRC. In conclusion, we have provided evidence for 3 new susceptibility loci for CRC. Our data also provide further evidence for the value of meta-analysis and the value of imputation as a means of enhancing the detection of novel risk loci thereby extending the utility of GWAS data."

34996992	TITLE	Genome-wide association study identifies tumor anatomical site-specific risk variants for colorectal cancer survival
34996992	ABSTRACT	Identification of new genetic markers may improve the prediction of colorectal cancer prognosis. Our objective was to examine genome-wide associations of germline genetic variants with disease-specific survival in an analysis of 16,964 cases of colorectal cancer. We analyzed genotype and colorectal cancer-specific survival data from a consortium of 15 studies. Approximately 7.5 million SNPs were examined under the log-additive model using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for clinical factors and principal components. Additionally, we ran secondary analyses stratifying by tumor site and disease stage. We used a genome-wide p-value threshold of 5 x 10-8 to assess statistical significance. No variants were statistically significantly associated with disease-specific survival in the full case analysis or in the stage-stratified analyses. Three SNPs were statistically significantly associated with disease-specific survival for cases with tumors located in the distal colon (rs698022, HR = 1.48, CI 1.30-1.69, p = 8.47 x 10-9) and the proximal colon (rs189655236, HR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.65-2.77, p = 9.19 x 10-9 and rs144717887, HR = 2.01, 95% CI 1.57-2.58, p = 3.14 x 10-8), whereas no associations were detected for rectal tumors. Findings from this large genome-wide association study highlight the potential for anatomical-site-stratified genome-wide studies to identify germline genetic risk variants associated with colorectal cancer-specific survival. Larger sample sizes and further replication efforts are needed to more fully interpret these findings.
34996992	INTRO	Introduction The global incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) has been increasing while the mortality rate has been decreasing. Advances in scientific knowledge, treatment modalities, and medical screening programs are considered among the major factors contributing to improved survival from this disease. In the USA, Canada, Australia, and Europe, 5-year survival is around 65%. Currently, CRC prognostication relies primarily on clinicopathological features with a primary focus on tumor characteristics, such as stage. Several additional factors, in relation to both the tumor (e.g. KRAS and BRAF mutations) and the individual, have been associated with survival times and clinical outcomes. Germline genetic variants are commonly investigated as candidate prognostic markers; they are abundant in the human genome, are polymorphic among patients, are thought to remain unchanged over time, and may biologically modify disease characteristics and risk of progression or clinical outcomes. These characteristics of germline genetic variants, therefore, make them attractive for cancer research studies. There is now a large body of research on genetic variants in relation to CRC incidence, yet no variants have been confidently associated with CRC survival or used in clinical practice. Many approaches have been attempted in survival outcomes studies, such as candidate SNP, gene, or pathway analyses, including the examination of associations with patient outcomes for variants identified in susceptibility studies. Compared with other study designs, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) offer a comprehensive, agnostic approach. Some CRC survival GWAS have been performed, which have identified a small number of genetic variants at the genome-wide significance level. While these studies have advanced the knowledge of the genetic basis of CRC survival, they have also been limited by relatively small number of cases, restricting the ability to identify modest associations or low frequency risk variants, which may only be apparent when large case cohorts are examined. In this study, we evaluated germline genetic loci associated with CRC-specific survival using data from 16,964 CRC participants included in an international consortium comprising 15 epidemiologic and clinical studies. As a secondary goal, we evaluated stage- and tumor site-specific associations between genetic loci and CRC survival.
34996992	RESULTS	Results Participant demographic and clinical characteristics are provided in Table 1. Median follow-up time after diagnosis was 13.8 years. Overall, 6,033 (36%) CRC cases died during follow up, of which 4,010 deaths (66%) were attributed to CRC. As expected, participants with stage 4 tumors at diagnosis were more likely to die from CRC (of those who died, 51% were stage 4 compared with 6% stage 1). Participants were ~ 50% female with a median age of 67 years (range 20-94 years). No substantial systemic inflation was identified from quantile-quantile (QQ) plots (Supplementary Fig. 1). No variants reached genome-wide significance for the primary GWAS (Fig. 1) or for the stage-stratified analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 3). Two variants were statistically significant at a genome-wide P-value threshold among proximal colon tumors and one among distal colon tumors (Table 2, Fig. 2). No variants reached genome-wide significance among rectal tumors. The significant variants identified among proximal colon tumors were located on chromosomes 12 (rs189655236, hazard ratio [HR] = 2.14, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.65-2.77, p = 9.19 x 10-9) and 14 (rs144717887, HR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.57-2.58, p = 3.14 x 10-8). Both variants were low frequency (MAF 1.4% and 1.5%, respectively) and neither were in linkage disequilibrium (LD; defined as R2 > 0.6) with nearby variants. The rs189655236 variant was located within the intronic region of BORCS5 and rs144717887 was located in an intergenic region. The variant significantly associated with CRC survival among distal colon tumors was located in an intergenic region on chromosome 14 (rs698022, HR = 1.48, CI 1.30-1.69, p = 8.47 x 10-9), was common with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 11%, and was not in LD (R2 < 0.6) with nearby variants. The two chromosome 14 variants identified in proximal and distal colon analyses were not in linkage disequilibrium with each other. None of the statistically significant variants were predicted to have regulatory effects (ranking scores = 4 or 5) as reported in the RegulomeDB database.

34996992	DISCUSS	Discussion In this analysis of common genetic variants in a sizeable study population, we did not identify any SNPs associated with CRC prognosis at the genome-wide significance level. We also found no SNPs associated with survival for specific tumor stages. However, our results suggest that there may be variants that predict CRC-survival for distal and proximal colon cancer cases. The distal and proximal regions of the colon differ biologically and in terms of tumor incidence rates. In addition, research shows that tumors located in these anatomical subsites display differences in molecular alterations involved in tumorigenesis, and are characterized by different disease progression and prognosis. The identification of different sets of variants with survival for cases with distal and proximal colon tumors in this study is, therefore, not surprising. Using eQTLGen, rs189655236 was predicted to be in cis-eQTL with DUSP16, which has been associated with chemotherapy resistance in colorectal cancer. However, none of the identified SNPs were predicted to have putative regulatory functions using RegulomeDB, and according to the dbSNP database, they are within intronic or intergenic sequences. Also, the two significant variants for proximal colon tumors are very low frequency. These considerations lead us to interpret our findings with caution pending further investigation. This study has several strengths. By leveraging data from 15 population-based and clinical studies, we were able to confidently examine with good statistical power genetic associations with CRC survival. Covariates were well characterized with detailed information on epidemiologic and clinical factors which allowed us to conduct subgroup analysis by stage at diagnosis and tumor anatomical location. In addition, we had a relatively long follow-up period and cause of deaths were uniformly ascertained. We also used an agnostic discovery-based approach to identify variants associated with CRC survival. Our study also has some limitations. Although we had a large enough sample size to identify significant SNPs in CRC cases with European ancestry, we were unable to evaluate other ancestry groups. Additionally, we were unable to evaluate other tumor markers that might be associated with survival in our population. Another limitation inherent to the GWAS approach is the high likelihood of false-negative findings due to the stringent P-value threshold for genome-wide significance. This threshold is set to account for multiple testing and is designed to reduce the number of false-positive findings; however, a consequence of this stringency is that some important SNP-survival associations may have been missed. Finally, no replication analysis or functional follow-up was conducted. In summary, in this largest yet GWAS for CRC specific survival, our analyses indicate that genetic variants in the form of SNPs are unlikely to explain variable risk of death from colorectal cancer in people of European ancestry. However, a few SNPs were identified that may be prognostic markers for distal or proximal colon cancers and these should be further examined in other populations, including cases from other ancestry groups.
34996992	METHODS	"Methods Study population Analyses utilized data from the International Survival Analysis in Colorectal Cancer Consortium (ISACC), a compilation of participants with incident, invasive CRC obtained from clinical trials, case-control, and cohort studies from around the world. Study participants included people of European genetic ancestry diagnosed with invasive CRC and with available genotyping and CRC-specific survival data (as described in the Supplementary Methods). The following 15 ISACC studies were included: the Cancer Prevention Study-II (CPS-II), the German Darmkrebs: Chancen der Verhutung durch Screening Study (DACHS), the Diet Activity and Lifestyle Study (DALS), the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN), the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC), the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS), the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the N9741 clinical trial, the Physician's Health Study (PHS), the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Study (PLCO), the UK Biobank (UKB), the VITamins And Lifestyle Study (VITAL), the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), and four Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR) sites: Seattle, Ontario, Australia, and the Mayo Clinic. Study-specific details are described in the Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. Ethical considerations Study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee overseeing the respective clinical sites. Participants provided informed consent for genetic testing and research participation. The study protocol has been approved by Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Institutional Review Board. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. Ascertainment of CRC-specific survival Protocols for survival outcomes assessment in this study population have been described previously. Briefly, studies ascertained vital status via linkage to the National Death Index, state cancer registries, state death records, or population registers with cause of death verified by death certificates (CPSII, DACHS, DALS, EPIC, MCCS, UKB, VITAL), or via active follow-up (CCFR, HPFS, NHS, PHS, PLCO, WHI, N9741) with dates and cause of death confirmed via regional mortality databases, review of death certificates and/or medical records by trained adjudicators. In all studies, cases alive at the most recent study follow-up or data linkage were censored on that date. In VITAL, individuals who moved outside of Washington State were censored at their date of move. CRC-specific survival was calculated as days from diagnosis to CRC-related death or end of follow-up. Individuals who died from causes other than CRC were censored at the time of death. Tumor stage and location classification Tumor stage was obtained from pathology and registry reports at the time of diagnosis. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) summary stage categorizations of localized, regional, and distant were used, also incorporating extent of disease information when available. Additionally, the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM classification of malignant tumors (TNM) categorizations were utilized to assign values I through IV. Tumor location was obtained from registry and pathology reports. Location was grouped based on ICD-9 codes as follows: (1) ""Proximal"" (153.0/Hepatic flexure, 153.1/Transverse colon, 153.4/Cecum, 153.6/Ascending colon), (2) ""Distal"" (153.2/Descending colon, 152.3/Sigmoid colon, 153.7/Splenic flexure), 3) ""Rectal"" (154.0/Rectosigmoid junction, 154.1/Rectum). Genotype data Genotyping methods have been reported previously. Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from blood or buccal samples using conventional methods, and samples were genotyped using the platforms listed in Supplementary Table 1. Each genotyping platform dataset underwent standard quality control analyses, including exclusion of samples and SNPs with low call rates (< 97% and < 98%, respectively), exclusion of variants departing from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (p < 1 x 10-4), exclusion of individual with discrepant reported and genotyped sex based on X chromosome heterozygosity, and exclusion of duplicates and individuals that were second-degree or more closely related based on identity by descent (IBD) calculations. Additionally, we inferred genetic ancestry using principal components analysis and excluded individuals of non-European ancestry from analyses due to small sample sizes. Participants with a value within one standard deviation of the median for the first and second eigenvectors were categorized as European genetic ancestry and included in the analysis (Supplementary Methods). A total of 16,964 individuals passed quality control filtering. Only variants passing quality control analyses and with missing call rates <= 2% were used for imputation. Phasing and imputation were performed on each pooled set of studies with the same or similar genotyping platforms. Autosomal variants were phased using SHAPEIT2 and imputed to the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel release 1.1 (~ 39 million variants) using the University of Michigan Imputation Server. Genotype probabilities were converted to allelic dosages. Evaluation was restricted to variants with MAF >= 1% and imputation accuracy R2 > 0.3. A total of 7,829,749 genetic variants were included in the analyses. All imputed and cleaned individual-level genotype data were pooled for survival analyses. We used PLINK (v1.9) for principal components analysis on pruned sets of autosomal variants obtained by removing regions with extensive long-range linkage disequilibrium. The first five principal components were used as coviariates to account for population substructure in analysis. Statistical analysis We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate HRs and 95% CIs for associations of each genetic variant with CRC-specific survival. A log-additive model was used, relating variant genotype dosage to CRC-specific survival. All models were adjusted for age at diagnosis, sex, a categorical variable encompassing genotyping platform and study, and five principal components to account for population substructure. The proportional hazards assumptions for age and sex were evaluated by testing for a non-zero slope of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals on ranked failure time. The tests for both age and sex were statistically significant (p < 0.05), suggesting the proportionality assumption may not hold. For age, the non-proportionality was resolved by including both a continuous and categorical variable (dichotomized at median age; <= 57 years versus > 57 years). We stratified our analysis by sex. As a secondary goal, we evaluated the association of genetic loci and CRC survival stratified by tumor stage at diagnosis and anatomical location. Tumor stage strata included regional (stages 2 and 3) and distant metastatic (stage 4) disease; local (stage 1) disease was not evaluated due to a low percentage of deaths among this group. Tumor anatomical location was grouped as ""proximal colon"" (ICD-9-CM 153.0/Hepatic flexure, 153.1/Transverse colon, 153.4/Cecum, 153.6/Ascending colon), ""distal colon"" (153.2/Descending colon, 152.3/Sigmoid colon, 153.7/Splenic flexure), or ""rectum"" (154.0/Rectosigmoid junction, 154.1/Rectum). We evaluated QQ plots of log-transformed p-values and calculated genomic control coefficients to assess for possible systemic inflation. We produced Manhattan plots and specified a genome-wide statistical significance level of p <= 5 x 10-8. We performed statistical analyses using R version 3.5.2. In silico analyses The NCI 'LDassoc' web tool (https://ldlink.nci.nih.gov/) was used to evaluate LD (defined as R2 > 0.6) in 1000 Genomes Phase 3 'EUR' population) for SNPs of interest. The putative functional effects of variants were inferred based on information in the RegulomeDB database. This database ranks variants ranging from 1-7 such that lower ranks represent variants with greater predicted regulatory impact (https://regulomedb.org/regulome-help/). For example, eQTLs (expression quantitative trait loci) have a rank of 1; variants locate in a transcription factor binding motif and DNAse peak have a rank of 4; and variants that locate in a transcription factor binding motif or a DNAse peak have a rank of 5. We additionally assessed cis-eQTLs using the eQTLGen Consortium database (https://www.eqtlgen.org/). ."
